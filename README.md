Hi everyone!

Based on community feedback, we are excited to announce the release of version 2.3.

This version introduces several **new features**:

- Excel File Format Support: Now handle Excel files seamlessly within the application.

- Undetermined Omics Support: You can now analyze any type of biological data not previously included in the listed omics. This feature performs t-tests and Wilcoxon tests between two groups, and prepares the data for MOFA integration. Integrating any type of data into your multi-omics analysis is now easier than ever!

**Bug Fixes**:

- The BiomiX interface now adapts smoothly to all screen sizes, even after resizing or expanding.

- Package conflicts on Linux and macOS have been resolved.
