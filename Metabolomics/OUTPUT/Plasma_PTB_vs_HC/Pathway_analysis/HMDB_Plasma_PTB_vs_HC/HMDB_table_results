SMP0000018	Alpha Linolenic Acid and Linoleic Acid Metabolism	Linoleic acid is a member of essential fatty acids called omega-6 fatty acids. It is an essential dietary requirement for all mammals. The other group of essential fatty acids is the omega-3 fatty acids (i.e. alpha-linolenic acid). After linoleic acid imports into cell, acyl-CoA 6-desaturase (fatty acid desaturase 2) catalyze linoleic acid to form gamma-linolenic acid (GLA); then GLA will be transformed to dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) by elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 5 (ELOVL5). DGLA will be final converted to arachidonic acid by acyl-CoA (8-3)-desaturase (fatty acid desaturase 1). Arachidonic acid will be converted to a group of metabolites called eicosanoids. Î±-Linolenic acid (ALA) has been considered as an important metabolite since it is seesnetial 18:3n or omega-3 fatty acid, and also it has to be acquired through diet. Once acquired, Î±-Linolenic acid can be â€œregeneratedâ€ endogenously by the cleavage of phospholipids into their constituent fatty acids by phospholipase A2. The resulting fatty acid can then be converted to stearidonic acid through the action of fatty acid desaturase 2. Î±-Linolenic acid is primarily used by the body in the synthesis of Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5, nâˆ’3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6, nâˆ’3), two fatty acids that play a vital role in many metabolic and cell signaling processes. These fatty acids are synthesized via fatty acid desaturase 2, fatty acid desaturase 1 and several elongase enzymes (Q9GZR5) in the liver. Î±-Linolenic acid is also in the regulation of lipid metabolism by activation of the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor alpha (PPARa).

SMP0000055	Alanine Metabolism	Alanine (L-Alanine) is an α-amino acid that is used for protein biosynthesis. Alanine transaminase can facilitate the reductive amination of pyruvate to produce alanine. L-Alanine can be converted to pyruvic acid by alanine aminotransferase 1 reversibly coupled with interconversion of oxoglutaric acid and L-glutamic acid. L-Alanine can also be produced by alanine-glyoxylate transaminase with coupled interconversion of glyoxylate and glycine. L-Alanine will be coupled with alanyl tRNA by alanyl-tRNA synthetase to perform protein biosynthesis. Alanine constitutes about 8% of human proteins. Under fasting conditions, alanine, derived from protein breakdown, can be converted to pyruvate and used to synthesize glucose via gluconeogenesis in the liver. Alternately, alanine, after conversion to pyruvate, can be fully oxidized via the TCA cycle in other tissues.

SMP0000009	Ammonia Recycling	Ammonia can be rerouted from the urine and recycled into the body for use in nitrogen metabolism. Glutamate and glutamine play an important role in this process. There are many other processes that act to recycle ammonia. asparaginase recycles ammonia from asparagine. Glycine cleavage system generates ammonia from glycine. Histidine ammonia lyase forms ammonia from histidine. Serine dehydratase also produces ammonia by cleaving serine.

SMP0000068	Androgen and Estrogen Metabolism	This pathway describes the inactivation and catabolism of male (androgen) and female (estrogen) hormones. Many steroid hormones are transformed by sulfatases, dehydrogenases and glucuronide transferases to enhance their solubility and to facilitate their elimination. Inactivation refers to the metabolic conversion of a biologically active compound into an inactive one. Peripheral inactivation (e.g. by liver enzymes) is required to ensure steady-state levels of plasma androgens and estrogens. Specifically, if an androgen or estrogen is to act as a "" chemical signal "", its half-life in the circulation must be limited, so that any change in secretion rate is immediately reflected by a change in its plasma concentration. But hormone inactivation can also occur in target tissues, notably after the hormone has triggered the relevant biological effects in order to ensure termination of hormone action. The main site of peripheral androgen/estrogen inactivation and catabolism is the liver, but some catabolic activity also occurs in the kidneys. Inactive androgens and estrogens are mainly eliminated as urinary (mostly conjugated) metabolites. This elimination requires conversion to hydrophilic compounds in order to ensure their solubility in biological fluids at rather high concentrations. Depending on the structure of the starting steroid there may be: 1) Reduction of a double bond at C-4 and reduction of an oxo(keto) group at C-3 to a secondary alcoholic group; 2) Reduction of an oxo group at C-20 to a secondary alcoholic group; 3) Oxidation of a 17ß-hydroxyl group; 4) Further hydroxylations at various positions of the steroid nucleus (e.g. 7-hydroxylation of 5a-reduced androgens) or 5) Conjugation (sulphate and/or glucuronide derivatives).

SMP0030406	Androstenedione Metabolism	Androstenedione is an endogenous weak androgen steroid hormone that is a precursor of testosterone and other androgens, as well as of estrogens like estrone (Wikipedia). Its metabolism occurs primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (membrane-associated enzymes are coloured dark green in the image). Conversion of androstenedione to testosterone requires the enzyme testosterone 17-beta-dehydrogenase 3. Conversion of androstenedione to estrone involves three successive reactions catalyzed by the enzyme aromatase (cytochrome P450 19A1). Androstenedione can also be converted into etiocholanolone glucuronide, androsterone glucuronide, and adrenosterone. The three-reaction subpathway to synthesize etiocholanolone glucuronide begins with the enzyme 3-oxo-5-beta-steroid 4-dehydrogenase catalyzing the conversion of androstenedione to etiocholanedione. This is followed by the conversion of etiocholanedione to etiocholanolone which is catalyzed by aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C4. Lastly, the large membrane-associated multimer UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1 catalyzes the conversion of etiocholanolone to etiocholanolone glucuronide. The three-reaction subpathway to synthesize androsterone glucuronide begins with the conversion of androstenedione to androstanedione via 3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase 1. Anstrostanedione is then converted into androsterone via aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C4. The last reaction to form androsterone glucuronide is catalyzed by the large multimer UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1. The two-reaction subpathway to synthesize adrenosterone begins in the mitochondrial inner membrane where androstenedione is first converted into 11beta-hydroxyandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione by the enzyme cytochrome P450 11B1. Following transport to the endoplasmic reticulum, 11beta-hydroxyandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione is converted into adrenosterone via corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase isozyme 1.

SMP0000075	Arachidonic Acid Metabolism	This pathway describes the production and subsequent metabolism of arachidonic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid. In resting cells arachidonic acid is present in the phospholipids (especially phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine) of membranes of the body’s cells, and is particularly abundant in the brain. Typically a receptor-dependent event, requiring a transducing G protein, initiates phospholipid hydrolysis and releases the fatty acid into the intracellular medium. Three enzymes mediate this deacylation reaction including phospholipase A2 (PLA2), phospholipase C (PLC), and phospholipase D (PLD). Once released, free arachidonate has three possible fates: 1) reincorporation into phospholipids, 2) diffusion outside the cell, and 3) metabolism. Arachidonate metabolism is carried out by three distinct enzyme classes: cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and cytochrome P450’s. Specifically, the enzymes cyclooxygenase and peroxidase lead to the synthesis of prostaglandin H2, which in turn is used to produce the prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes. The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase leads to 5-HPETE, which in turn is used to produce the leukotrienes, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and lipoxins. Some arachidonic acid is converted into midchain HETEs, omega-chain HETEs, dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by cytochrome P450 epoxygenase hydroxylase activity. Several products of these pathways act within neurons to modulate the activities of ion channels, protein kinases, ion pumps, and neurotransmitter uptake systems, affecting processes such as cellular proliferation, inflammation, and hemostasis. The newly formed eicosanoids may also exit the cell of origin and bind to G-protein-coupled receptors present on nearby neurons or glial cells.

SMP0000020	Arginine and Proline Metabolism	Arginine and proline metabolism pathway illustrates arginine, ornithine, proline, citrulline and glutamate metabolism in homo sapiens. The cytosolic enzymes such as argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) will synthesize citrulline into argininosuccinic acid, and then argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) will synthesize further from argininosuccinic acid to arginine. Glutamate and 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (glutamate's precursor) will biosynthesize to form proline. Citrulline is derived from ornithine through proline, glutamine or glutamate's catabolism. Generation of proline and glutamate from ornithine in mitochondria is important since many of the reactions required proline and glutamate. Because of arginine, glutamine, and proline related sub-pathways are all bidirectional; hence, cell type and developmental stage of the cell will mainly decide the net utilization or production of these amino acids. In small intestine, epithelial cells will produce citrulline from glutamine and glutamate primarily; alongside with the extraction of citrulline from circulation via kidney's proximal tubule cells, and then convert citrulline into arginine for returning back to circulation. Therefore, the damage or impariment of small bowel or renal function will greatly increasing the dietary requirement due to the reducing of endogenous arginine synthesis. Proline and arginine (protegenic amino acids) will incorporate into proteins by prolyl-tRNA and arginyl-tRNA with synthesis of their respective tRNA synthetases. In epithelial cells, ornithine is used primarily to synthesize citrulline and arginine, which make it as a key component of the arginine/proline metabolic pathway. In liver cells (surrounding by the portal vein), ornithine functions primarily as an intermediate of the urea cycle, with surrounding central vein, ornithine is used to synthesize glutamate and glutamine while in many peripheral tissues.

SMP0000067	Aspartate Metabolism	Aspartate is synthesized by transamination of oxaloacetate by aspartate aminotransferase or amino acid oxidase. Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase can then couple aspartate to aspartyl tRNA for protein synthesis. The aspartate content in human proteins is about 7%. Asparagine synthase can convert aspartate to the polar amino acid asparagine. Aspartate is also a precursor for cellular signaling compounds such as, N-acetyl-aspartate, beta-alanine, adenylsuccinate, arginino-succinate and N-carbamoylaspartate. Aspartate is also a metabolite in the urea cycle and involved in gluconeogenesis. Additionally, aspartate carries the reducing equivalents in the mitochondrial malate-aspartate shuttle, which utilizes the ready interconversion of aspartate and oxaloacetate. The conjugate base of L-aspartic acid, aspartate, also acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain which activates NMDA receptors.

SMP0000052	Beta Oxidation of Very Long Chain Fatty Acids	Fatty acid degradation in most organisms occurs primarily via the beta-oxidation cycle.  In mammals, beta-oxidation occurs in both mitochondria and peroxisomes, whereas plants and most fungi harbor the beta-oxidation cycle only in the peroxisomes.  However, the oxidation ceases at octanyl CoA.  It is believed that very long chain (greater than C-22) fatty acids undergo initial oxidation in peroxisomes which is followed by mitochondrial oxidation.  One significant difference is that oxidation in peroxisomes is not coupled to ATP synthesis.  Instead, the high-potential electrons are transferred to O2, which yields H2O2.  The enzyme catalase, found exclusively in peroxisomes, converts the hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.  Peroxisomal β-oxidation also requires enzymes specific to the peroxisome and to very long fatty acids.  There are three key differences between the enzymes used for mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation: beta-oxidation in the peroxisome requires the use of a peroxisomal carnitine acyltransferase (instead of carnitine acyltransferase I and II used by the mitochondria) for transport of the activated acyl group into the peroxisome.  The first oxidation step in the peroxisome is catalyzed by the enzyme acyl CoA oxidase.  The beta-ketothiolase used in peroxisomal beta-oxidation has an altered substrate specificity, different from the mitochondrial beta-ketothiolase.  In mitochondria, the beta-oxidation pathway includes four reactions that occur in repeating cycles with each fatty acid molecule.  In each cycle, a fatty acid is progressively shortened by two carbons as it is oxidized and its energy captured by the reduced energy carriers NADH and FADH2.  At the end of each cycle of four reactions, one acetyl-CoA two-carbon unit is released from the end of the fatty acid, which then goes through another round of beta-oxidation, continuing to oxidize and shorten even-chain fatty acids until they are entirely converted to acetyl-CoA.  The acetyl-CoA generated in beta-oxidation enters the TCA cycle, where it is further oxidized to CO2, producing more reduced energy carriers, NADH and FADH2.  These carriers produced in the TCA cycle, along with those produced directly in beta-oxidation, transfer their energy to the electron transport chain where they drive the creation of the proton gradient that supports mitochondrial ATP production.  Another destination of acetyl-CoA is the production of ketone bodies by the liver that are transported to tissues like the heart and brain for energy.

SMP0000007	beta-Alanine Metabolism	Beta-alanine, 3-aminopropanoic acid, is a non-essential amino acid. Beta-Alanine is formed by the proteolytic degradation of beta-alanine containing dipeptides: carnosine, anserine, balenine, and pantothenic acid (vitamin B5). These dipeptides are consumed from protein-rich foods such as chicken, beef, pork, and fish. Beta-Alanine can also be formed in the liver from the breakdown of pyrimidine nucleotides into uracil and dihydrouracil and then metabolized into beta-alanine and beta-aminoisobutyrate. Beta-Alanine can also be formed via the action of aldehyde dehydrogenase on beta-aminoproionaldehyde which is generated from various aliphatic polyamines. Under normal conditions, beta-alanine is metabolized to aspartic acid through the action of glutamate decarboxylase. It addition, it can be converted to malonate semialdehyde and thereby participate in propanoate metabolism. Beta-Alanine is not a proteogenic amino acid. This amino acid is a common athletic supplementation due to its belief to improve performance by increased muscle carnosine levels.

SMP0000123	Betaine Metabolism	Betaine (or trimethylglycine) is similar to choline (trimethylaminoethanol) but differs in choline's terminal carboxylic acid group trimethylglycine is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Betaine is obtained from diet as betaine or compounds containing choline in foods such as whole grains, beets and spinach. Betaine can also be synthesized from choline in the liver and kidney.  First, choline is oxidized to betaine aldehyde by mitochondrial choline oxidase (choline dehydrogenase). Then, betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase oxidizes betaine aldehyde to betaine in the mitochondria or cytoplasm. In the liver, betaine functions as a methyl donor similar to choline, folic acid, S-adenosyl methionine and vitamin B12. Methyl donors are important for liver function, cellular replication and detoxification reactions. Betaine is also involved in the production of carnitine to protect from kidney damage and functions as an osmoprotectant in the inner medulla.

SMP0000035	Bile Acid Biosynthesis	Bile acids are made in the liver by the cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of cholesterol.  They are conjugated with taurine or the amino acid glycine, or with a sulfate or a glucuronide, and are then stored in the gallbladder.  Upon eating a meal, the contents of the gallbladder are secreted into the intestine, where bile acids serve the purpose of emulsifying dietary fats.  Bile acids serve other functions, including eliminating cholesterol from the body, driving the flow of bile to eliminate catabolites from the liver, emulsifying lipids and fat soluble vitamins in the intestine, and aiding in the reduction of the bacteria flora found in the small intestine and biliary tract.  Bile acids formed by synthesis in the liver are termed ""primary"" bile acids, and those made by bacteria are termed ""secondary"" bile acids.  In the liver, synthesis of bile acids and bile salts is initiated with the conversion of cholesterol esters (from circulating lipoprotein particles) to cholesterol, then to 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol then to 4-cholesten-7alpha-ol-3-one.  The pathway then branches: hydroxylation of 4-cholesten-7alpha-ol-3-one to 4-cholesten-7alpha, 12alpha-diol-3-one leads ultimately to the formation of cholate, while its reduction to 5beta-cholestan-7alpha-ol-3-one leads to the formation of chenodeoxycholate.  Chenodeoxycholate has two hydroxyl groups at positions 3-alpha and 7-alpha and is a key bile acid.  Its chief drawback lies in the ability of intestinal bacteria to remove the 7-alpha hydroxyl group via dehydroxylation.  The resulting bile acid has only a 3-alpha hydroxyl group and is termed lithocholic acid.  To avoid the problems associated with the production of lithocholic acid, most mammals add a third hydroxyl group at the 12 position to chenodeoxycholic acid to create cholic acid.  In this manner, the subsequent removal of the 7-alpha hydroxyl group by intestinal bacteria will result in a less toxic, still functional dihydroxy bile acid.  In the intestine, cholic acid is dehydroxylated to form the dihydroxy bile acid deoxycholic acid.  Prior to secretion by the liver, they are conjugated with either the amino acid glycine or taurine through conversion to a Coenzyme A derivative and subsequent conjugation.  In the body, glycocholate, taurocholate, glycochenodeoxycholate, and taurochenodeoxycholate are released from hepatocytes into the bile and ultimately into the lumen of the small intestine, where they function as detergents to solubilize dietary fats.  Conjugation increases water solubility, preventing passive re-absorption once secreted into the small intestine.  As a result, the concentration of bile acids in the small intestine can stay high enough to form micelles and solubilize lipids.  Bile acids, in particular chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and cholic acid (CA), can regulate the expression of genes involved in their synthesis, thereby, creating a feed-back loop.  The elucidation of this regulatory pathway came about as a consequence of the isolation of a class of receptors called the farnesoid X receptors, FXRs.  The FXRs belong to the superfamily of nuclear receptors that includes the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family as well as the liver X receptors (LXRs), retinoid X receptors (RXRs), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs).  The FXR genes are expressed at highest levels in the intestine and liver.

SMP0000066	Biotin Metabolism	Biotin is a vitamin that is an essential nutrient for humans. Biotin can be absorbed from consuming various foods such as: legumes, soybeans, tomatoes, romaine lettuce, eggs, cow's milk, oats and many more. Biotin acts as a cofactor for enzymes to catalyze carboxylation reactions involved in gluconeogenesis, amino acid catabolism and fatty acid metabolism. Biotin deficiency has been associated with many human diseases. These diseases may be caused by dysfunctional biotin metabolism due to enzyme deficiencies. Some research suggests biotin may play a role in transcription regulation or protein expression which may lead to biotin related diseases.

SMP0000073	Butyrate Metabolism	Butyrate metabolism (Butanoate metabolism) describes the metabolic fate of a number of short chain fatty acids or short chain alcohols that are typically produced by intestinal fermentation. Many of these molecules are eventually used in the production of ketone bodies, the creation of short-chain lipids or as precursors to the citrate cycle, glycolysis or glutamate synthesis. The molecule for which this pathway is named, butyric acid, is a four-carbon fatty acid that is formed in the human colon by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates (including dietary fiber). It is found in rancid butter, parmesan cheese, and vomit, and has an unpleasant odor and acrid taste, with a sweet aftertaste (similar to ether).

SMP0000028	Caffeine Metabolism	Caffeine is obtained from diet including coffee and other beverages and is absorbed in the stomach and small intestine. In the liver, the cytochrome P450 oxidase enzyme system and specifically CYP1A2 metabolizes caffeine into paraxanthine to increase lipolysis and increase free fatty acids and glycerol levels in the blood, theobromine to dilate blood vessels and increase urine volume and theophylline which relaxes bronchi smooth muscles. In the lysosome, these metabolites undergo further metabolism into methyluric acids before being excreted in the urine. There is genetic variability in the metabolism of caffeine due to the polymorphism of CYP1A2. This variability can affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of caffeine and may affect an individual's consumption.

SMP0020986	Cardiolipin Biosynthesis	Cardiolipin (CL) is an important component of the inner mitochondrial membrane where it constitutes about 20% of the total lipid composition. It is essential for the optimal function of numerous enzymes that are involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism (Wikipedia). Cardiolipin biosynthesis occurs mainly in the mitochondria, but there also exists an alternative synthesis route for CDP-diacylglycerol that takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum. This second route may supplement this pathway. All membrane-localized enzymes are coloured dark green in the image. First, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (or glycerone phosphate) from glycolysis is used by the cytosolic enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [NAD(+)] to synthesize sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. Second, the mitochondrial outer membrane enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase esterifies an acyl-group to the sn-1 position of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate to form 1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (lysophosphatidic acid or LPA). Third, the enzyme 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase converts LPA into phosphatidic acid (PA or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate) by esterifying an acyl-group to the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone. PA is then transferred to the inner mitochondrial membrane to continue cardiolipin synthesis. Fourth, magnesium-dependent phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase catalyzes the conversion of PA into CDP-diacylglycerol. Fifth, CDP-diacylglycerol--glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferase synthesizes phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP). Sixth, phosphatidylglycerophosphatase and protein-tyrosine phosphatase dephosphorylates PGP to form phosphatidylglycerol (PG). Last, cardiolipin synthase catalyzes the synthesis of cardiolipin by transferring a phosphatidyl group from a second CDP-diacylglycerol to PG.

SMP0000465	Carnitine Synthesis	Carnitine is an ammonium compound that exists in two stereoisomers, of which only L-carnitine is biologically active. Carnitine can be obtained from dietary sources and also biosynthesized. It is necessary for fatty acid oxidation, transporting fatty acids from the cystosol to the mitochondria, where they are broken down via the citric acid cycle to release energy. Carnitine is synthesized from lysine residues in existing proteins. These residues are methylated using lysine methyltransferase enzymes and methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine, then removed from the protein via hydrolysis. In the next step, the N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine is converted to 3-hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine t via the mitochondrial enzyme trimethyllysine dioxygenase. The 3-hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine is then cleaved to 4-trimethylammoniobutanal and glycine, likely by an aldose identical to serine hydroxymethyltransferase. Next, 4-trimethylammoniobutanal is oxidized by the 4-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase protein to 4-trimethylammoniobutanoic acid. Finally, 4-trimethylammoniobutanoic acid is transformed into L-carnitine via the enzyme gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase. The reactions in the carnitine synthesis pathway occur ubiquitously in the human body with the exception of the last step, as the gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase enzyme is found only in the liver and kidney (and at very low levels in the brain). The produced carnitine is then carried to other tissue via a number of transport systems.

SMP0000012	Catecholamine Biosynthesis	The Catecholamine Biosynthesis pathway depicts the synthesis of catecholamine neurotransmitters. Catecholamines are chemical hormones released from the adrenal glands as a response to stress that activate the sympathetic nervous system. They are composed of a catechol group and are derived from amino acids. The commonly found catecholamines are epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and dopamine. They are synthesized in catecholaminergic neurons by four enzymes, beginning with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which generates L-DOPA from tyrosine. The L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine via aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), which becomes  norepinephrine via dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH); and finally is converted to epinephrine via phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT).

SMP0000057	Citric Acid Cycle	The citric acid cycle, which is also known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) or the Krebs cycle, is a series of enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions of key importance in all living cells that use oxygen as part of cellular respiration. In eukaryotes, the citric acid cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. The TCA cycle begins with acetyl-CoA transferring its two-carbon acetyl group to the four-carbon acceptor compound (oxaloacetate) to form a six-carbon compound (citrate). The citrate then goes through a series of chemical transformations, losing first one, then a second carboxyl group as CO2. The carbons lost as CO2 originate from what was oxaloacetate, not directly from acetyl-CoA. The carbons donated by acetyl-CoA become part of the oxaloacetate carbon backbone after the first turn of the citric acid cycle. Loss of the acetyl-CoA-donated carbons as CO2 requires several turns of the citric acid cycle. However, because of the role of the citric acid cycle in anabolism, they may not be lost since many TCA cycle intermediates are also used as precursors for the biosynthesis of other molecules. Most of the energy made available by the oxidative steps of the cycle is transferred as energy-rich electrons to NAD+, forming NADH. For each acetyl group that enters the citric acid cycle, three molecules of NADH are produced. At the end of each cycle, the four-carbon oxaloacetate has been regenerated, and the cycle continues.

D-Amino acid oxidase (DAAO) is one of the main enzymes that metabolize D-Amino acids via deamination.

SMP0015896	De Novo Triacylglycerol Biosynthesis	A triglyceride (TG, triacylglycerol, TAG, or triacylglyceride) is an ester derived from glycerol and three fatty acids.  De novo biosynthesis of triglycerides is also known as the phosphatidic acid pathway, and it is mainly associated with the liver and adipose tissue.  All membrane-localized enzymes are coloured dark green in the image.  First, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (or glycerone phosphate) from glycolysis is used by the cytosolic enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [NAD(+)] to synthesize sn-glycerol 3-phosphate.

The enzyme 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase converts LPA into phosphatidic acid (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate) by esterifying an acyl-group to the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone.  Next, magnesium-dependent phosphatidate phosphatase catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid into diacylglycerol.

SMP0000468	Degradation of Superoxides	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed by the normal metabolic process of oxygen. Examples are superoxide, oxygen ions and peroxides and can be of either organic or inorganic origin. ROS are highly reactive due to unpaired valence shell electrons, and can cause serious damage to cells and cell organelles. The environment also may cause ROS to form, from sources such as drought, air pollutants, UV light, cold temperatures, and external chemicals. An organic example of ROS being formed is during the beta oxidation of fatty acids, or photorespiration in photosynthetic organisms. Aerobic organisms who produce energy through the electron transport chain in mitochondria produce ROS as a byproduct. ROS damage commmonly includes DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, oxidation of amino acids in proteins, and oxidatively inactivating enzymes by oxidation of cofactors. Most aerobic organisms have adapted to this dangerous condition of life, and have a system of enzymes and scavenging free radicals. Enzymes such as are essential for defense against ROS, and include superoxide dismutases (SODs) and hydroperoxidase (CAT). Superoxide dismutases are the primary method of disposal of ROS, and convert superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and water. Catalase attacks the hydrogen peroxide produced by SODs, and converts it into oxygen and water. In skin cells, 5,6 dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid oxidase in the melanosome membranes breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.

SMP0030880	Estrone Metabolism	Estrone (also known as oestrone) is a weak endogenous estrogen, a steroid and minor female sex hormone. Estrone is synthesized from cholesterol and secreted from gonads. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the place that estrone undergoes primary metabolism. Estrone sulfate and estrone glucuronide are the conjugated product of estrone; and CYP450 can hydroxylate estrone into catechol estrogens. The enzyme catechol O-methyltransferase catalyzes the conversion of 2-hydroxyestrone into 2-methoxyestrone which is used to synthesize 2-methoxyestrone 3-glucuronide via the membrane-associated massive multimer UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1. Estrone can also be reversibly converted into estradiol by estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase 1. This same enzyme can reversibly convert 16a-hydroxyestrone (synthesized from estrone via cytochrome P450 3A5) into estriol. Estriol is alternatively synthesized from estradiol via cytochrome P450 3A5.

SMP0000449	Ethanol Degradation	Ethanol metabolism in humans occurs mainly in the liver, though degradation has also been shown in gastric, pancreatic, and lung tissue. Ethanol degradation occurs via four pathways, three of which are oxidative pathways and are depicted here. The fourth is a nonoxidative pathway which is less well studied but known to produce fatty acid ethyl esters. Each of the three oxidative pathways is differentiated by the mechanism utilized to oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde in the first step. In the alcohol dehydrogenase mediated ethanol degradation pathway (I), cytoplasmic alcohol dehydrogenase produces the acetaldehyde from the ethanol. In the MEOS mediated ethanol degradation pathway (II), the ethanol enters the endoplasmic reticulum, where the Microsomal Ethanol Oxidising System (MEOS), also know as also known as cytochrome P-450 2E1, does the oxidizing and returns the acetaldehyde to the cytoplasm. In the catalase mediated ethanol degradation pathway (III), the oxidation occurs in the peroxisome via peroxisomal catalase, with the resulting acetaldehyde being released to the cytoplasm. In each of the three oxidative pathways the cytosolic acetaldehyde then enters the mitochondrial compartment, where it is converted to acetate by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase. The acetate leaves the mitochondria and moves to extra-hepatic tissues for further metabolism. In extra-hepatic cells the acetate is converted to acetyl-CoA via either cytoplasmic or mitochondrial acetyl-CoA synthetase. The alcohol dehydrogenase mediated ethanol degradation pathway (I) is the predominant mechanism of catabolism under conditions of acute alcohol consumption. However, under conditions of chronic ethanol consumption the MEOS mediated ethanol degradation pathway (II) and nonoxidative pathway are induced to assist with ethanol degradation.

SMP0000456	Fatty Acid Biosynthesis	The biosynthesis of fatty acids primarily occurs in liver and lactating mammary glands. The entire synthesis process which produces palmitic acid occurs on a multifunctional dimeric protein Fatty Acid Synthase (FA) in the cytosol. The production of palmitic acid can be summarized as the successive addition of two carbons to an initial acetyl moiety primer. After 7 cycles palimitic acid is released.  The synthesis starts with the sequential transfer of a primer substrate, acetyl-CoA, to the nucleophilic serine residue of the acyltransferase domain of FA. The acetyl moiety is then transferred to the Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP) domain of FA, then finally to the active site of the beta-ketoacyl synthase domain. A chain extender substrate, molonyl-CoA, is transferred to the nucleophilic serine residue of the acyltransferase domain and subsequently to the ACP domain. The acetyl moiety is extend by a condensation reaction, catalysed by the beta-ketoacyl synthase domain, that produces a new Carbon-Carbon bound, this reaction is coupled to a decarboxylation resulting in the production of carbon dioxide. Subsequently beta-ketoacyl condensation product is reduced to a saturated acyl moiety through the step wise action on the beta-ketoacyl reductase, beta-hydroxyacyl dehydrase and enoyl reductase domains respectively. This saturated acyl moiety is then transfer back to the active site of the beta-ketoacyl synthase domain, another molonyl-CoA is loaded and the process repeats. The addition of molonyl moieties occurs 7 times after which the final product is released by that action of thioesterase domain. The final product is 16 carbon long palmitic acid.

SMP0000054	Fatty Acid Elongation in Mitochondria	Cells typically contain large amounts of C18 and C20 fatty acids. Longer chain fatty acids are found in certain specialized tissues (myelin contains high amounts of C22 and C24 components). Even longer chain fatty acids are derived from either dietary sources or from elongation of C16-CoA or C18-CoA formed by the cytoplasmic fatty acid synthetase system. All of the fatty acids needed by the body can be synthesized from palmitate (C16:0) except the essential, polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleate and linolenate. To create longer, shorter, oxidized, reduced fatty acids, palmitic acid is subjected to enzymatic reactions by reductases, hydroxylases, elongases and mixed function oxidases. There are 3 major processes that modify palmitic acid: elongation, desaturation and hydroxylation. Elongation of fatty acids may occur at endoplasmic reticulum where fatty acid molecules of length up to C24 may be produced. Mitochondrial elongation may result in fatty acids up to C16 in length. Fatty acid elongation in mitochondria is essentially the reverse of beta-oxidation for fatty acid oxidation. In particular, both pathways make use of acetyl-CoA acyltransferase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and enoyl-CoA hydratase. The final step of fatty acid elongation uses enoyl-CoA reductase (not part of the beta-oxidation pathway). The elongation takes place in the mitochondrial matrix. In liver and kidney fatty acid elongation operates best in the presence of both NADH and NADPH, whereas in heart and skeletal muscle, only NADH is required. The mitochondrial pathway is important for elongating fatty acids containing 14 or fewer carbon atoms. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of less than six carbons. Medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 612 carbons. Long chain fatty acids (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails longer than 12 carbons. Very Long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails longer than 22 carbons.

SMP0000051	Fatty Acid Metabolism	Fatty acids constitute a large energy source for the body. The cellular membrane is also made up of fatty acids. During starvation times, fatty acids can provide energy to humans for numerous days. Fatty acid metabolism is also known as beta-oxidation. During metabolism, acetyl CoA is produced that can then enter the citric acid cycle. When ATP is needed, ATP may be generated by increasing fatty acid metabolism. Fatty acid metabolism is essentially the reverse reaction of fatty acid synthesis.

SMP0000053	Folate Metabolism	The 1-carbon transformations require folic acid (folate). Folic acid participates in both the activation of single carbons as well as in the oxidation and reduction of single carbons. Folate-dependent single-carbon reactions are important in amino acid metabolism and in biosynthetic pathways leading to DNA, RNA, membrane lipids, and neurotransmitters. To carry out the transfer of 1-carbon units, NADPH must reduce folic acid two times in the cell. The pyrazine ring of the 6-methylpterin is reduced at each of the two N-C double bonds. More precisely, the pathway leading to the formation of tetrahydrofolate (THF) begins when folate (F) is reduced to dihydrofolate (DHF) which is then reduced to THF. Dihydrofolate reductase catalyses the last step. Vitamin B3 in the form of NADPH is a necessary cofactor for both steps of the synthesis. The resulting 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (THF) is the acceptor of 1-carbon groups. Tetrahydrofolate accepts methyl groups, usually from serine. The product, N5,N10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate, is the central compound in 1-carbon metabolism. Methylene-THF (CH2FH4) is formed from THF by the addition of methylene groups from one of three carbon donors: formaldehyde, serine, or glycine. Tetrahydrofolate can also accept a methyl group from the complete breakdown of glycine. The N5,N10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate can either donate its single-carbon group directly, be oxidized by NADP to the methenyl form, or be reduced by NADH to the methyl form. Depending on the biosynthetic pathway involved, any of these species can donate the 1-carbon group to an acceptor. The methylene form donates its methyl group during the biosynthesis of thymidine nucleotides for DNA synthesis, the methenyl form donates its group as a formyl group during purine biosynthesis, and the methyl form is the donor of the methyl group to sulfur during methionine formation. Methyl tetrahydrofolate (CH3-THF) can be made from methylene-THF by reduction of the methylene group with NADPH. Another form of THF, formyl-THF or folinic acid) results from oxidation of methylene-THF or is formed from formate donating formyl group to THF. Finally, histidine can donate a single carbon to THF to form methenyl-THF.

SMP0000064	Fructose and Mannose Degradation	Fructose and mannose are monosaccharides that can be found in many foods. Fructose can join with glucose to form sucrose. Mannose can be converted to glucose. Both may be used as food sweeteners. Fructose is well absorbed, especially in the presence of glucose. Fructose causes less of an insulin response compared to glucose and thus may be a preferred sugar for diabetics. In contrast to fructose, humans do not metabolize mannose well with the majority of it being excreted unchanged. Mannose in the urine can be beneficial in treating urinary tract infections caused be E. coli. However, mannose can be detrimental to humans by causing diabetic complications.

SMP0000043	Galactose Metabolism	This pathway depicts the conversion of galactose into glucose, lactose and other sugar intermediates that may be used for a range of metabolic process.  The milk sugar, lactose, is hydrolyzed in the intestine to its constituent monosaccharides, glucose and galactose.  Galactose is metabolized primarily in the liver, in a sequence of three reactions that yield one molecule of glucose 1-phosphate per molecule of galactose.  First, galactose is phosphorylated to yield galactose 1-phosphate.  Then, galactose 1-phosphate and UDP-glucose react to form UDP-galactose and glucose 1-phosphate, and UDP-galactose undergoes epimerization to form UDP-glucose.  The UDP-glucose can be used in gucuronidation reactions and other pentose interconversions.  In a reaction shared with other pathways, glucose 1-phosphate can be converted into glucose 6-phosphate.  Also shown in this pathway is how glucose is changed into galactose via a process called hexoneogenesis in order to enable the mammary glands to secrete lactose.  However, most galactose in breast milk is synthesized from galactose taken up from the blood, and only 35% is made by de novo synthesis.  Glycerol also contributes some to the mammary galactose production.  Also depicted in this pathway are the conversions of other dietary di and tri-saccharides (raffinose, manninotriose, melbiose, stachyose) into galactose, glucose and fructose.

SMP0000128	Gluconeogenesis	Gluconeogenesis, which is essentially the reverse of glycolysis, results in the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates such as lactate, glycerol, and glucogenic amino acids. In animals, gluconeogenesis takes place mainly in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the cortex of kidneys. This process occurs during periods of fasting, starvation, or intense exercise. Gluconeogenesis is often associated with ketosis. Several non-carbohydrate carbon substrates can enter the gluconeogenesis pathway. One common substrate is lactic acid, formed during anaerobic respiration in skeletal muscle. Lactate may also come from red blood cells, which obtain energy solely from glycolysis as they have no membrane-bound organelles for aerobic respiration. Lactate is transported back to the liver where it is converted into pyruvate by the Cori cycle using the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate, the first designated substrate of the gluconeogenic pathway, can then be used to generate glucose. All citric acid cycle intermediates, through conversion to oxaloacetate, amino acids other than lysine or leucine, and glycerol can also function as substrates for gluconeogenesis.

SMP0000127	Glucose-Alanine Cycle	Simply stated, this cycle involves muscle protein being degraded to provide more glucose to generate additional ATP for muscle contraction. Alanine plays a key role in glucose-alanine cycle between tissues and liver. In muscle and other tissues that degrade amino acids for fuel, amino groups are collected in the form of glutamate by transamination. Glutamate can then transfer its amino group through the action of alanine aminotransferase to pyruvate, a product of muscle glycolysis, forming alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate. The alanine formed is passed into the blood and transported to the liver. A reverse of the alanine aminotransferase reaction takes place in liver. Pyruvate regenerated forms glucose through gluconeogenesis, which returns to muscle through the circulation system. Glutamate in the liver enters mitochondria and degrades into ammonium ion through the action of glutamate dehydrogenase, which in turn participates in the urea cycle to form urea. The glucose-alanine cycle enables pyruvate and glutamate to be removed from the muscle and find their way to the liver. Glucose is regenerated from pyruvate and then returned to muscle. The energetic burden of gluconeogenesis is thus imposed on the liver instead of the muscle. All available ATP in muscle is devoted to muscle contraction.

SMP0000072	Glutamate Metabolism	Glutamate is one of the non-essential amino acids that is produced by the body. Glutamate is precursor for many nucleic acids and proteins in addition to its role in the central nervous system. It is an excitatory neurotransmitter and has a role in neuronal plasticity, affecting memory and learning.  Glutamate plays a role in numerous metabolic pathways. Dysfunctional glutamate metabolism may cause disorders such as: gyrate atrophy, hyperammonemia, γ-hydoxybutyric aciduria, hemolytic anemia, and 5-oxoprolinuria.

SMP0000015	Glutathione Metabolism	Glutathione (GSH) is an low-molecular-weight thiol and antioxidant in various species such as plants, mammals and microbes. Glutathione plays important roles in nutrient metabolism, gene expression, etc. and sufficient protein nutrition is important for maintenance of GSH homeostasis. Glutathione is synthesized from glutamate, cysteine, and glycine sequentially by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and GSH synthetase. L-Glutamic acid and cysteine are synthesized to form gamma-glutamylcysteine by glutamate-cysteine ligase that is powered by ATP. Gamma-glutamylcysteine and glycine can be synthesized to form glutathione by enzyme glutathione synthetase that is powered by ATP, too. Glutathione exists oxidized (GSSG) states and in reduced (GSH) state. Oxidation of glutathione happens due to relatively high concentration of glutathione within cells.

SMP0000124	Glycerol Phosphate Shuttle	The glycerol phosphate shuttle also known as the glycerophosphate shuttle. It shuttles electrons to mitochondrial carriers in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway from cytosolic NADH. This shuttle relies on mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH). This is also a common process for the cell  to regenerate cytosolic NAD+ for other processes.

SMP0000039	Glycerolipid Metabolism	This pathway depicts the synthesis of glycerolipids such as diacylglycerol (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAGs), phosphatidic acids, lysophosphatidic acids and several glycolipids.  The synthesis of diacylglycerol (DAG) begins with glycerol-3-phosphate, which is derived primarily from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), a product of glycolysis (usually in the cytoplasm of liver or adipose tissue cells) or from glycerol itself.  Glycerol-3-phosphate is first acylated with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to form lysophosphatidic acid.  Once synthesized, lysophosphatidic acid is then acylated with another molecule of acyl-CoA to yield phosphatidic acid.  Phosphatidic acid is then de-phosphorylated to form diacylglycerol.  Specifically, diacylglycerol is formed by the action of phosphatidate phosphatase on phosphatidic acid coupled with the release of a phosphate.  The phosphatase exists as 3 isozymes.  Diacylglycerol is a precursor to triacylglycerol (triglyceride), which is formed in the addition of a third fatty acid to the diacylglycerol under the catalysis of diglyceride acyltransferase.  Since diacylglycerol is synthesized via phosphatidic acid, it will usually contain a saturated fatty acid at the C-1 position on the glycerol moiety and an unsaturated fatty acid at the C-2 position.  When the body uses stored fat as a source of energy, glycerol and fatty acids are released into the bloodstream.  The glycerol component can be converted to glucose by the liver and provides energy for cellular metabolism.  The fatty acids go through beta-oxidation which splits the long carbon chains of the fatty acid into acetyl CoA, which can eventually enter the TCA cycle.  The energy yield from a gram of fatty acids is approximately 9 Kcal (39 kJ), compared to 4 Kcal/g (17 kJ/g) for carbohydrates.  Since the hydrocarbon portion of fatty acids is hydrophobic, these molecules, can be stored in a relatively anhydrous (water free) environment.  Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are more highly hydrated.  For example, 1 g of glycogen can bind approximately 2 g of water, which translates to 1. 33 Kcal/g (4 Kcal/3 g).  This means that fatty acids can hold more than six times the amount of energy. 5 lb (31 kg) of hydrated glycogen to have the energy equivalent to 10 lb (5 kg) of fat.  Also shown in this pathway is the synthesis of various mono-and diglycosyldiacylglyerols.  These relatively rare lipids exist in both diacyl and alkyl acyl forms, and contain mainly saturated and monoenoic fatty acid components, with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 comprising 90% or more of the total.  The carbohydrate moieties in these glycolipids may consist of galactose or glucose.  The biosynthesis of the galactosyldiacylglycerols has been studied in vitro and there appears to be an enzyme that catalyses the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to diacylglycerol.  The function of the galactolipids is still a matter for conjecture.  They probably have a role in myelination, and may also have a function in cell differentiation and intracellular signalling.  The glucolipids in saliva and related secretions may be involved in a defense mechanism against microbial attack.

SMP0000004	Glycine and Serine Metabolism	This pathway describes the synthesis and breakdown of a number of small amino acids, including glycine, serine, and cysteine. All of these compounds share common intermediates and almost all can be biosynthesized from one another. Serine and glycine are not essential amino acids and can be synthesized from a number of routes. For example, serine can be synthesized via glycerate, which can be converted to glycerate 3-phosphate (via glycerate kinase), which in turn is converted to phosphohydroxypyruvate and then phosphoserine and finally serine. The serine synthesized via this route, can create cysteine and glycine through the homocysteine cycle. Cystathionine beta-synthase catalyses the condensation of homocysteine and serine to give cystathionine. Cystathionine beta-lyase then converts this double amino acid to cysteine, ammonia, and α-ketoglutarate. Serine can also be used in polypeptide synthesis (via Seryl-tRNA synthetase) or in phosphatidylserine synthesis. Glycine is biosynthesized in the body from the amino acid serine. In most organisms, the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase catalyses this transformation using tetrahydrofolate (THF), leading to methylene THF and glycine. Glycine can be degraded via three pathways. The predominant pathway in animals involves the Glycine Cleavage System. This leads to the degradation of glycine into ammonia and CO2. In the second pathway, glycine is degraded in two steps. The first step is the reverse of glycine biosynthesis from serine with serine hydroxymethyl transferase. Serine is then converted to pyruvate by serine dehydratase. In the third route to glycine degradation, glycine is converted to glyoxylate by D-amino acid oxidase. Glyoxylate is then oxidized by hepatic lactate dehydrogenase to oxalate in an NAD+-dependent reaction. Glycine also functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.

SMP0000040	Glycolysis	Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway with sequence of ten reactions involving ten intermediate compounds that converts glucose to pyruvate. Glycolysis release free energy for forming high energy compound such as ATP and NADH. Glycolysis is consisted of two phases, which one of them is chemical priming phase and second phase is energy-yielding phase. As the starting compound of chemical priming phase, D-glucose can be obtained from galactose metabolism or imported by monosaccharide-sensing protein 1 from outside of cell. D-Glucose is catalyzed by probable hexokinase-like 2 protein to form glucose 6-phosphate which is powered by ATP.  Glucose 6-phosphate transformed to fructose 6-phosphate by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, which the later compound will be converted to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, which is the last reaction of chemical priming phase  by 6-phosphofructokinase with cofactor magnesium, and it is also powered by ATP. Before entering the second phase, aldolase catalyzing the hydrolysis of F1,6BP into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate can convert to each other bidirectionally by facilitation of triosephosphate isomerase. The second phase of glycolysis is yielding-energy phase that produce ATP and NADH. At the first step, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is catalyzed to glyceric acid 1,3-biphosphate by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with NAD, which also generate NADH. ATP is generated through the reaction that convert glyceric acid 1,3-biphosphate to 3-phosphoglyceric acid. Phosphoglycerate mutase 2 catalyze 3-phosphoglyceric acid to 2-Phospho-D-glyceric acid,  and alpha-enolase with cofactor magnesium catalyzes 2-Phospho-D-glyceric acid to phosphoenolpyruvic acid. Eventually, plastidial pyruvate kinase 4 converts phosphoenolpyruvic acid to pyruvate with cofactor magnesium and potassium and ADP. Pyruvate will undergo pyruvate metabolism, tyrosine metabolism and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis.

SMP0000044	Histidine Metabolism	 Histidine is unique in that its biosynthesis is inherently linked to the pathways of nucleotide formation.  The biosynthesis of histidine in adults begins with the condensation of ATP and PRPP (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate) to form N-5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (phosphoribosyl-ATP).  It is also worth noting that PRPP is the starting point for purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis.  Subsequent histidine biosynthetic steps (from phosphoribosyl-ATP onwards) likely take place in the intestinal microflora.  Elimination of the phosphate and the opening of the ring in phosphoribosyl-ATP forms phosphoribosyl-forminino-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (phosphoribosyl-formimino-AICAR-phosphate).  This is subsequently converted to 5-phosphoribulosyl-forminino-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide.  Cleavage of this intermediate results in the formation of imidazole glyercol phosphate and AICAR (aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide) with glutamine playing a role as an amino group donor.  AICAR is recycled through the purine pathway while the imidazole glycerol phosphate is converted to imidazole acetal phosphate.  Transamination yields histidinol phosphate which is converted to histidinol and finally to histidine.  Histidine catabolism begins with release of the α-amino group catalyzed by histidase, leading to the deaminated product, urocanate.  Urocanate is converted to 4-imidazolone-5-propionate via the action of urocanate hydratase.  The latter product is then converted to N-formiminoglutamte via the action of imidazolone propionase.  The enzyme formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase then removes the formimino group to yield glutamate.  Because the end product of histidine catabolism is glutamate this makes histidine one of the glucogenic amino acids.  Another key feature of histidine catabolism is that it serves as a source of ring nitrogen to combine with tetrahydrofolate (THF), producing the 1-carbon THF intermediate known as N5-formiminoTHF.  The latter reaction is one of two routes to N5-formiminoTHF.  Decarboxylation of histidine in the intestine by bacteria gives rise to histamine.  Similarly, histamine arises in many tissues by the decarboxylation of histidine, which in excess causes constriction or dilation of various blood vessels.  Once histamine is generated it can be converted to several breakdown products including N-methylhistamine, imidazole acetaldehyde, methylimidazole acetaldehyde and methylimidazole-acetic acid.  Histidine is also a precursor for carnosine biosynthesis (via carnosine synthase), with beta-alanine being the rate limiting precursor.   Anserine can be synthesized either from carnosine via carnosine N-methyltransferase or from 1-methylhistidine via carnosine synthase.   Inversely, cytosolic non-specific dipeptidase catalyzes the synthesis of 1-methylhistidine from anserine.

SMP0000455	Homocysteine Degradation	Homocysteine is an amino acid and homologue of cysteine that appears in the body as a result of the degradation of methionine. In mammals, homocysteine is used to biosynthesize cysteine via the following pathway. First the enzyme cystathionine beta-synthetase irreversibly condenses homocysteine with L-serine, forming L-cystathionine. The L-cystathionine is then cleaved by cystathionine gamma-lyase, producing 2-oxobutanoate, L-cysteine, and ammonia. The 2-oxobutanoate is further broken down via the 2-oxobutanoate degradation pathway, producing citric acid cycle intermediates, while the L-cysteine goes to the cysteine metabolism pathway. The homocysteine degradation pathway composes a part of the larger methionine metabolism pathway.

SMP0000011	Inositol Metabolism	Inositol (also known as myo-inositol) is a carbocyclic polyol that plays an important role as the structural basis for a number of secondary messengers in eukaryotic cells, including inositol phosphates, phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) lipids. It is found in many foods, in particular, in cereals with high bran content, nuts, beans, and fruit, especially cantaloupe melons and oranges. Inositol is not considered a vitamin itself because it can be synthesised by the body. Myo-Inositol is synthesized from glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) in two steps. First, G-6-P is isomerised by inositol-3-phosphate synthase (ASYNA1) to myo-inositol 3-phosphate, which is then dephosphorylated by inositol monophosphatase (IMPase 1) to give free myo-inositol. The synthesis of phosphatidylinositol is catalyzed by phosphatidylinositol synthase and involves CDP-diacylglycerol and myo-inositol. Phosphatidylinositol phosphate lipids are a product of class I, II and III phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases) acting on phosphatidylinositol. Many inositol phosphates are made by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol phosphates by phospholipase C. They may also be synthesized or remodeled via various kinases and phosphatases.

SMP0000462	Inositol Phosphate Metabolism	Inositol phosphates are a group of molecules that are important for a number of cellular functions, such as cell growth, apoptosis, cell migration, endocytosis, and cell differentiation. Inositol phsosphates consist of an inositol (a sixfold alcohol of cyclohexane) phosphorylated at one or more positions. There are a number of different inositol phosphates found in mammals, distinguishable by the number and position of the phosphate groups. Inositol phosphate can be formed either as a product of phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism or from glucose 6-phosphate via the enzyme inositol-3-phosphate synthase 1. Conversion between the different types of inositol phosphates then occurs via a number of specific inositol phosphate kinases and phosphatases, which add (kinase) or remove (phosphatase) phosphate groups. The differing roles of the numerous inositol phosphates means that their metabolism must be tightly regulated. This is done via the localization and activation/deactivation of the various kinases and phosphatases, which can be found in the cytoplasm, nucleus or endoplasmic reticulum. The unphosphorylated inositol ring can be used to produce phosphoinositides through phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism.

SMP0000071	Ketone Body Metabolism	Ketone bodies are consisted of acetone, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. In liver cells' mitochondria, acetyl-CoA can synthesize acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate; and spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate will form acetone. Metabolism of ketone body (also known as ketogenesis) contains several reactions. Acetoacetic acid (acetoacetate) will be catalyzed to form acetoacetyl-CoA irreversibly by 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1 that also coupled with interconversion of succinyl-CoA and succinic acid. Acetoacetic acid can also be catalyzed by mitochondrial D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase to form (R)-3-Hydroxybutyric acid with NADH. Ketogenesis occurs mostly during fasting and starvation.  Stored fatty acids will be broken down and mobilized to produce large amount of acetyl-CoA for ketogenesis in liver, which can reduce the demand of glucose for other tissues. Acetone cannot be converted back to acetyl-CoA; therefore, they are either breathed out through the lungs or excreted in urine.

SMP0000457	Lactose Degradation	Lactose degradation (Lactose metabolism) shows the breakdown of alpha lactose into its constituent sugars, which are then utilized by the body as an energy source. Alpha-Lactose is the major sugar present in milk and the main source of energy supplied to the newborn mammalian in its mother’s milk. Lactose is also an important osmotic regulator of lactation. It is digested by the intestinal lactase, an enzyme expressed in newborns. Its activity declines following weaning. Lactase hydrolyzes alpha lactose into D-glucose and D-galactose, which are actively transported into the intestinal epithelial cells via the SGLT1 (GLUT1) cotransporter. GLUT1 actively transports glucose and galactose with 2 sodium ions. A sodium/potassium ATPase makes ATP by moving three sodium ions to the blood per two potassium ions that cross into the epithelial cell, giving the GLUT1 transporter energy to work. D-glucose and D-galactose diffuse into the blood, facilitated by the SLC2A2 transporter on the basolateral membrane on the intestinal epithelial cells. The sugars are then transported to liver.

SMP0000444	Lactose Synthesis	Lactose synthesis occurs only in the mammary glands, producing lactose (4-O-B-D-galactosylpyranosyl-a-D-glucopyranoside), the major sugar in milk. Lactose is created by joining two monosaccarides with a B1,4 glycosidic bond. Glucose is first converted to UDP-galactose via the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. UDP-galactose is then transported into the Golgi by the UDP galactose translocator, an antiporter which uses facilitated transport to move UDP galactose into the Golgi and exports UMP. Once inside the Golgi, the UDP galactose and glucose (which moves into the golgi via the GLUT-1 transporter) become substrates for the lactose synthase enzyme complex, comprised of the enzymatic subunit, galactosyltransferase with its regulatory subunit, Alpha-lactalbumin. Lactose synthase creates lactose through bonding galactose from UDP to glucose through a glycosidic bond. Although GT is found in many tissues in the body, Alpha-lactalbumin is only found on the inner surface of the Golgi in the mammary glands, limiting lactose production to the mammaries.

SMP0000037	Lysine Degradation	The degradation of L-lysine happens in liver and it is consisted of seven reactions. L-Lysine is imported into liver through low affinity cationic amino acid transporter 2 (cationic amino acid transporter 2/SLC7A2). Afterwards, L-lysine is imported into mitochondria via mitochondrial ornithine transporter 2.  L-Lysine can also be obtained from biotin metabolism. L-Lysine and oxoglutaric acid will be combined to form saccharopine by facilitation of mitochondrial alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase, and then, mitochondrial alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase will further breaks saccharopine down to allysine and glutamic acid. Allysine will be degraded to form aminoadipic acid through alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. Oxoadipic acid is formed from catalyzation of mitochondrial kynurenine/alpha-aminoadipate aminotransferase on aminoadipic acid. Oxoadipic acid will be further catalyzed to form glutaryl-CoA, and glutaryl-CoA converts to crotonoyl-CoA, and crotonoyl-CoA transformed to 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. 3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA will form Acetyl-CoA as the final product through the intermediate compound: acetoacetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA will undergo citric acid cycle metabolism. Carnitine is another key byproduct of lysine metabolism (not shown in this pathway).

SMP0000129	Malate-Aspartate Shuttle	The malate-aspartate shuttle (also known as the malate shuttle) is used by mitochondria for translocating electrons produced during glycolysis across the impermeable inner membrane for oxidative phosphorylation. This allows the hydrogen ions of the cofactor NADH produced in the cytosol to reach the electron transport chain in the mitochondria and generate ATP. The shuttle system is required because the inner membrane is impermeable to NADH and its oxidized form NAD+. NAD+/NADH does not cross the membrane, only ions (attached to malate) cross it. In this particular shuttle process, oxaloacetate on the cytoplasmic side is first reduced by NADH, creating malate and NAD+. Malate and the electrons it carries are transported into the mitochondria across the inner mitochondrial membrane, in exchange for alpha-ketoglutarate, which is transported out of the mitochondria. Once inside, the energy in malate is extracted again by reducing NAD+ to make NADH, thereby regenerating oxaloacetate. This NADH is then free to transfer its electrons to the electron transport chain. The oxaloacetate is transaminated with glutamate to make aspartate and alpha-ketoglutarate. Aspartate is returned to the cytosol by the aspartate-glutamate transporter, which moves glutamate into the mitochondria as it transports aspartate out. The net result is that NADH is transported into the mitochondria, generating 3 ATP molecules for every NADH transported in from the cytosol.

SMP0000033	Methionine Metabolism	Methionine metabolism in mammals consists of 2 pathways, the methionine cycle and the transsulfuration sequence. These pathways share 3 common reactions with both including the conversion of methionine to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM),the utilization of SAM in diverse transmethylation reactions yielding a methylated product plus S-adenosylhomocysteine, and the cleavage of S-adenosylhomocysteine to yield homocysteine and adenosine. The transulfuration reactions that produce cysteine from homocysteine and serine also produce α-ketobutyrate, the latter being converted first to propionyl-CoA and then via a 3-step process to succinyl-CoA. Regulation of the methionine metabolic pathway is based on the availability of methionine and cysteine. If both amino acids are present in adequate quantities, SAM accumulates and is a positive effector on cystathionine synthase, encouraging the production of cysteine and α-ketobutyrate (both of which are glucogenic). However, if methionine is scarce, SAM will form only in small quantities, thus limiting cystathionine synthase activity.

SMP0000482	Mitochondrial Beta-Oxidation of Long Chain Saturated Fatty Acids	 Fatty acids and their CoA esters are found throughout the body, playing roles such as components of cellular lipids, regulators of enzymes and membrane channels, ligands for nuclear receptors, precursor molecules for hormones, and signalling molecules.  Beta-oxidation occurs in the peroxisomes and mitochondria, the latter of which is depicted here.  Whether beta-oxidation starts in the mitochondria or the peroxisome depends on the length of the fatty acid.  Medium to long chain fatty acids go directly to the mitochondria, whereas very long chain fatty acids (>22 carbons) may be first metabolized down to octanyl-CoA in the peroxisomes and then transported to the mitochondria for the remainder of the oxidation.   Beta-oxidation begins with activation of fatty acids by an acyl-coenzyme A synthetase.  ATP is used to produce reactive fatty acyl adenylate that can then react with coenzyme A to produce a fatty acyl-CoA.  Short and medium chain fatty acids can enter the mitochondria directly via diffusion where they are activated in the mitochondrial matrix by acyl-coenzyme A synthetases.  In the first step of the beta-oxidation cycle, a double bond between C-2 and C-3 is formed, producing a trans-Δ2-enoyl-CoA.  This is catalyzed by acyl-CoA-dehydrogenases in the mitochondria, which have forms specific to the different lengths of fatty acids.  In the second step, enoyl CoA hydratase hydrates the newly formed double bond between C-2 and C-3, producing an L-beta-hydroxyacyl CoA.  Next, L-beta-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase converts the hydroxyl group into a keto group, producing a beta-ketoacyl CoA.  In the fourth and final step, the enzyme beta-ketothiolase cleaves the β-ketoacyl CoA and inserts the thiol group of another CoA between C-2 and C-3, reducing the acyl-CoA by 2 carbons and generating acetyl-CoA.  The final two steps also have enzymatic forms specific to short chain fatty acids.

SMP0000481	Mitochondrial Beta-Oxidation of Medium Chain Saturated Fatty Acids	Beta-oxidation is the major degradative pathway for fatty acid esters in humans. Fatty acids and their CoA esters are found throughout the body, playing roles such as components of cellular lipids, regulators of enzymes and membrane channels, ligands for nuclear receptors, precursor molecules for hormones, and signalling molecules. Beta-oxidation occurs in the peroxisomes and mitochondria, the latter of which is depicted here. Whether beta-oxidation starts in the mitochondria or the peroxisome depends on the length of the fatty acid. Medium to long chain fatty acids go directly to the mitochondria, whereas very long chain fatty acids (>22 carbons) may be first metabolized down to octanyl-CoA in the peroxisomes and then transported to the mitochondria for the remainder of the oxidation.  Beta-oxidation begins with activation of fatty acids by an acyl-coenzyme A synthetase. ATP is used to produce reactive fatty acyl adenylate that can then react with coenzyme A to produce a fatty acyl-CoA. Short and medium chain fatty acids can enter the mitochondria directly via diffusion where they are activated in the mitochondrial matrix by acyl-coenzyme A synthetases. In the first step of the beta-oxidation cycle, a double bond between C-2 and C-3 is formed, producing a trans-Δ2-enoyl-CoA. This is catalyzed by acyl-CoA-dehydrogenases in the mitochondria, which have forms specific to the different lengths of fatty acids. In the second step, enoyl CoA hydratase hydrates the newly formed double bond between C-2 and C-3, producing an L-beta-hydroxyacyl CoA. Next, L-beta-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase converts the hydroxyl group into a keto group, producing a beta-ketoacyl CoA. In the fourth and final step, the enzyme beta-ketothiolase cleaves the β-ketoacyl CoA and inserts the thiol group of another CoA between C-2 and C-3, reducing the acyl-CoA by 2 carbons and generating acetyl-CoA. The final two steps also have enzymatic forms specific to short chain fatty acids. Additionally, there is a trifunctional protein complex with enzymatic activity capable of performing all of the final 3 steps (hydratase, dehydrogenase, thiolase) in medium to very long chain fatty acids. This four step cycle repeats, removing 2 carbons from the fatty acid each time until it becomes acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is necessary for the citric acid cycle, among other cellular processes.

A double bond is formed between C-2 and C-3 to produce trans-Δ2-enoyl-CoA which is catalyzed by acyl-CoA-dehydrogenases in the mitochondria. Enoyl CoA hydratase then hydrates the double bond between C-2 and C-3 to produce a L-beta-hydroxyacyl CoA which then has its hydroxyl group converted to a keto group to produce beta-ketoacyl CoA. Finally, the beta-ketoacyl CoA is cleaved by beta-ketothiolase and a thiol group is inserted between C-2 and C-3 to reduce the acyl-CoA and produce acetyl-CoA.

SMP0000355	Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain	The Electron Transport Chain is a series of redox reactions, electrons travel down the chain releasing their energy in controlled steps. These reactions drive the active transport of H+ ions from the mitochondrial matrix , through the inner membrane to the intermembrane space. The respiratory chain consists of five main types of carrier; flavins, iron-sulfur centres, quinones, cytochromes (heme proteins) and copper. The two main reducing equivalents entering the respiratory chain are NADH and FADH2. NADH is linked through the NADH-specific dehydrogenase whereas FADH2 is reoxidised within succinate dehydrogenase and a ubiquinone reductase of the fatty acid oxidation pathway. Oxygen is the final acceptor of electrons and with H+ ions, is converted to form water, the end product of aerobic cellular respiration.

SMP0000048	Nicotinate and Nicotinamide Metabolism	Nicotinate (niacin) and nicotinamide are precursors of the coenzymes nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+). When NAD+ and NADP+ are interchanged in a reaction with their reduced forms, NADH and NADPH respectively, they are important cofactors in several hundred redox reactions. NAD+ is synthesized through two metabolic pathways. It is produced either in a de novo pathway from amino acids, or in salvage pathways by recycling preformed components such as nicotinamide back to NAD+. Most organisms synthesize NAD+ de novo from simple components. The specific set of reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from tryptophan (Trp) in animals, or aspartic acid in some bacteria (intestinal microflora) and plants. The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose group. An adenylate group is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid group in NaAD is amidated to a nicotinamide (Nam) group, forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. In a further step, some NAD+ is converted into NADP+ by NAD+ kinase, which phosphorylates NAD+. Besides assembling NAD+ de novo from simple amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing nicotinamide. Although other precursors are known, the three natural compounds containing the nicotinamide ring and used in these salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (Na), nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). The precursors are fed into the NAD+ biosynthetic pathwaythrough adenylation and phosphoribosylation reactions. These compounds can be taken up from the diet, where the mixture of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are called vitamin B3 or niacin. However, these compounds are also produced within cells, when the nicotinamide group is released from NAD+ in ADP-ribose transfer reactions.

SMP0000010	Nucleotide Sugars Metabolism	Nucleotide sugars are defined as any nucleotide in which the distal phosphoric residue of a nucleoside 5'-diphosphate is in glycosidic linkage with a monosaccharide or monosaccharide derivative. There are nine sugar nucleotides and they can be classified depending on the type of the nucleoside forming them: UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GlcUA, UDP- Xyl, GDP-Man, GDP-Fuc and CMP-NeuNAc. In nucleotide sugar metabolism the nucleotide sugars act as donors for sugar residues in the glycosylation reactions that produce polysaccharides. They are substrates for glycosyltransferases. The nucleotide sugars are also intermediates in nucleotide sugar interconversions that produce some of the activated sugars needed for glycosylation reactions. Since most glycosylation takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus, there are a large family of nucleotide sugar transporters that allow nucleotide sugars to move from the cytoplasm, where they are produced, into the organelles where they are consumed.

SMP0000030	Oxidation of Branched-Chain Fatty Acids	Fatty acid degradation in most organisms occurs primarily via the beta-oxidation cycle. In mammals, beta-oxidation occurs in both mitochondria and peroxisomes, whereas plants and most fungi harbor the beta-oxidation cycle only in the peroxisomes. Although the fatty acid oxidation scheme works neatly for even- numbered chain lengths, it can’t work completely for fatty acids that contain an odd number of carbons or branched chain fatty acids such as phytanic acid. Beta-oxidation of these compounds leads to propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, rather than to two acetyl-CoA at the final step. The propionyl-CoA is not a substrate for the TCA cycle or other simple pathways. For example, phytanic acid, found in animal milk, can’t be oxidized directly by beta-oxidation because the addition of water is a problem at the branched beta-carbon. The first step in the digestion of this compound is the oxidation of the carbon by molecular oxygen. Then the original carboxyl group is removed as CO2, leaving a shorter chain. This chain can now be accommodated by the beta-oxidation reactions, because the new beta-carbon now lacks a methyl group. In mitochondria, the beta-oxidation pathway includes four reactions that occur in repeating cycles with each fatty acid molecule. In each cycle, a fatty acid is progressively shortened by two carbons as it is oxidized and its energy captured by the reduced energy carriers NADH and FADH2. At the end of each cycle of four reactions, one acetyl-CoA two-carbon unit is released from the end of the fatty acid, which then goes through another round of beta-oxidation, continuing to oxidize and shorten even-chain fatty acids until they are entirely converted to acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA generated in beta-oxidation enters the TCA cycle, where it is further oxidized to CO2, producing more reduced energy carriers, NADH and FADH2. These carriers produced in the TCA cycle, along with those produced directly in beta-oxidation, transfer their energy to the electron transport chain where they drive the creation of the proton gradient that supports mitochondrial ATP production. Another destination of acetyl-CoA is the production of ketone bodies by the liver that are transported to tissues like the heart and brain for energy.

SMP0000027	Pantothenate and CoA Biosynthesis	Panthothenate (vitamin B5) is the precursor of coenzyme A and is the prosthetic group of acyl carrier protein (ACP). Its name is derived from the Greek pantothen meaning ""from everywhere"" and small quantities of pantothenic acid are found in nearly every foodstuff. Coenzyme A (CoA) may act as an acyl group carrier to form acetyl-CoA and other related compounds and is used as a way to transport carbon atoms within the cell. CoA is important in energy metabolism for pyruvate to enter TCA cycle as acetyl-CoA, and for α-ketoglutarate to be transformed to succinyl-CoA in the cycle. CoA is also important in the biosynthesis of many important compounds such as fatty acids, cholesterol, and acetylcholine. About 85% of dietary pantothenic acid is as CoA or phosphopentetheine. In the intestinal lumen, these undergo hydrolysis to phosphopantetheine, then pantetheine. Intestinal mucosal cells have high pantetheinase activity and rapidly hydrolyze pantetheine to yield free pantothenic acid. Coenzyme A is synthesized in a five-step process from pantothenate. First, antothenate (Vitamin B5) is phosphorylated to 4'-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme pantothenate kinase, next a cysteine is added to 4'-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase to form 4'-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC). In the next step, PPC is decarboxylated to 4'-phosphopantetheine by phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase. In the fourth step, 4'-phosphopantetheine is adenylylated to form dephospho-CoA by the enzyme phosphopantetheine adenylyl transferase. Finally, dephospho-CoA is phosphorylated using ATP to coenzyme A by the enzyme dephosphocoenzyme A kinase. CoA undergoes dephosphorylation, catalyzed by lysosomal acid phosphatasae to dephospho-CoA, followed by pyrophosphatase action to release 4’-phosphotantetheine and 5’AMP. Red blood cells contain pantothenic acid, pantetheine 4’-phosophate and pantetheine.

SMP0000031	Pentose Phosphate Pathway	The pentose phosphate pathway (also called phosphogluconate pathway, or hexose monophosphate shunt or the pentose phosphate shunt) is a process that serves to generate NADPH and the synthesis of pentose (5-carbon) sugars.  It is responsible for the generation of a substantial fraction of the cytoplasmic NADPH required for biosynthetic reactions, and for the generation of ribose 5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis.  Although the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis are distinct, they involve three common intermediates: glucose 6-phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and fructose 6-phosphate, so the two pathways are interconnected.  Dietary pentose sugars derived from the digestion of nucleic acids may be metabolized through the pentose phosphate pathway, and the carbon skeletons of dietary carbohydrates may be converted into glycolytic/gluconeogenic intermediates.  The pentose phosphate pathway consists of a total of eight reactions:1) Conversion glucose 6-phosphate to D-glucono-1,5-lactone 6-phosphate, with the formation of NADPH; 2) Conversion of D-glucono-1,5-lactone 6-phosphate to 6-phospho-D-gluconate; 3) Conversion of 6-phospho-D-gluconate to ribulose 5-phosphate, with the formation of NADPH; 4) Conversion of ribulose 5-phosphate to xylulose 5-phosphate; 5) Conversion of ribulose 5-phosphate to ribose 5-phosphate; 6) Rearrangement of ribose 5-phosphate and xylulose 5-phosphate to form sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; 7) Rearrangement of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to form erythrose 4-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate; and 8) Rearrangement of xylulose 5-phosphate and erythrose 4-phosphate to form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.  There are two distinct phases in the pathway, the oxidative branch and the non-oxidative branch.  The oxidative branch involves reactions 1-3 and generates NADPH and pentose 5-phosphate.  The non-oxidative branch of the pathway, which involves reactions 4-8, converts pentose 5-phosphate to other 5-carbon sugars.  The overall pathway can operate to generate only NADPH.  The reactions of the non-oxidative branch can operate to generate net amounts of ribose 5-phosphate with no production of NADPH.   .

SMP0000126	Phenylacetate Metabolism	Phenylacetate metabolism is of clinical importance because it facilitates conjugation with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine, which can be excreted in the urine.  This route provides an alternative pathway for nitrogen excretion in patients with urea cycle defects.  This conjugation proceeds in two steps.  First, phenylacetate and ATP react with coenzyme A to form phenylacetyl CoA, AMP, and pyrophosphate.  In the second step, phenylacetyl CoA and glutamine react to form phenyacetyl glutamine and Coenzyme A.

SMP0000008	Phenylalanine and Tyrosine Metabolism	In man, phenylalanine is an essential amino acid which must be supplied in the dietary proteins.  Once in the body, phenylalanine may follow any of three paths.  It may be (1) incorporated into cellular proteins, (2) converted to phenylpyruvic acid, or (3) converted to tyrosine.  Tyrosine is found in many high protein food products such as soy products, chicken, turkey, fish, peanuts, almonds, avocados, bananas, milk, cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese, lima beans, pumpkin seeds, and sesame seeds.  Tyrosine can be converted into L-DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline).  Depicted in this pathway is the conversion of phenylalanine to phenylpyruvate (via amino acid oxidase or tyrosine amino transferase acting on phenylalanine), the incorporation of phenylalanine and/or tyrosine into polypeptides (via tyrosyl tRNA synthetase and phenylalyl tRNA synthetase) and the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine via phenylalanine hydroxylase.  This reaction functions both as the first step in tyrosine/phenylalanine catabolism by which the body disposes of excess phenylalanine, and as a source of the amino acid tyrosine.  The decomposition of L-tyrosine begins with an α-ketoglutarate dependent transamination through the tyrosine transaminase to para-hydroxyphenylpyruvate.  The next oxidation step catalyzed by p-hydroxylphenylpyruvate-dioxygenase creates homogentisate.  In order to split the aromatic ring of homogentisate, a further dioxygenase, homogentistate-oxygenase, is required to create maleylacetoacetate.  Fumarylacetate is created by the action maleylacetoacetate-cis-trans-isomerase through rotation of the carboxyl group created from the hydroxyl group via oxidation.  This cis-trans-isomerase contains glutathione as a coenzyme.  Fumarylacetoacetate is finally split via fumarylacetoacetate-hydrolase into fumarate (also a metabolite of the citric acid cycle) and acetoacetate (3-ketobutyroate).

SMP0014212	Phosphatidylcholine Biosynthesis	Phosphatidylcholines (PC) are a class of phospholipids that incorporate a phosphocholine headgroup into a diacylglycerol backbone. They are the most abundant phospholipid in eukaryotic cell membranes and has both structural and signalling roles. In eukaryotes, there exist two phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis pathways: the Kennedy pathway and the methylation pathway. The Kennedy pathway begins with the direct phosphorylation of free choline into phosphocholine followed by conversion into CDP-choline and subsequently phosphatidylcholine. It is the major synthesis route in animals. The methylation pathway involves the 3 successive methylations of phosphatidylethanolamine to form phosphatidylcholine.  The first reaction of the Kennedy pathway involves the cytosol-localized enzyme choline/ethanolamine kinase catalyzing the conversion of choline into phosphocholine. Second, choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, catalyzes the conversion of phosphocholine to CDP-choline. Last, choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase catalyzes phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis from CDP-choline. It requires either magnesium or manganese ions as cofactors.  A parallel Kennedy pathway forms phosphatidylethanolamine from ethanolamine - the only difference being a different enzyme, ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, catalyzing the second step.   Phosphatidylethanolamine is also synthesized from phosphatidylserine in the mitochondrial membrane by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase.  Phosphatidylethanolamine funnels into the methylation pathway in which phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) then catalyzes three sequential N-methylation steps to convert phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine. PEMT uses S-adenosyl-L-methionine as a methyl donor.

SMP0029731	Phosphatidylethanolamine Biosynthesis	Phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) are the second most abundant phospholipid in eukaryotic cell membranes, and contrary to phosphatidylcholine, it is concentrated with phosphatidylserine in the cell membrane's inner leaflet. In Homo sapiens, there exist two phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis pathways. In the visualization, all enzymes that are dark green in colour are membrane-localized. The first pathway synthesizes phosphatidylethanolamine from ethanolamine via the Kennedy pathway. First, the cytosol-localized enzyme choline/ethanolamine kinase catalyzes choline to convert to phosphocholine. Second, choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, catalyzes phosphocholine to convert to CDP-choline. Last, choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase catalyzes phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis from CDP-choline. It requires either magnesium or manganese ions as cofactors. Phosphatidylethanolamine is also synthesized from phosphatidylserine at the mitochondrial inner membrane by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase. Phosphatidylserine, itself, is synthesized using a base-exchange reaction with phosphatidylcholine. This reaction is catalyzed by phosphatidylserine synthase which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

SMP0000463	Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate Metabolism	Phosphatidylinositol phosphates, or phosphoinositides, are intracellular signaling lipids. Seven different phosphoinositides have been identified in mammals, each distinguished by the number and/or position of the phosphate groups on the inositol ring. The inositol can be mono-, di-, or triphosphorylated, with the remaining phosphoinositides being isomers of these three forms. Phosphoinositides regulate a variety of signal transduction processes, thus playing a number of important roles in the cell, such as actin cytoskeletal reorganization, membrane transport, and cell proliferation. They may also affect protein localization, aggregation, and activity by acting as secondary messengers. The ability of the cell to recognize the different types of phosphoinositides as different cellular signals means that their synthesis and metabolism must be tightly regulated. Synthesis begins with the attachment of an inositol phosphate head group to diacylglycerol via a phospholipase C enzyme, creating a phosphoinositide. Conversion between the different types of phosphoinositides is then done by a number of specific phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases, which add (kinase) and remove (phosphatase) phosphates from the inositol ring. The specific localization and regulation of the phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases thus controls the activity of the phosphoinositides. While the phosphoinositides are always located in the membrane, their particular kinases and phosphatases may be found in the cytoplasm or in the membrane of the cell or cell organelles.

SMP0000025	Phospholipid Biosynthesis	This pathway describes the synthesis of the common phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol and cardiolipins. Phospholipids can be synthesized by two mechanisms. One utilizes a CDP-activated polar head group for attachment to the phosphate of phosphatidic acid. The other utilizes CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol and an inactivated polar head group. Phospholipids are synthesized in the ER membrane from cytosolic precursors. Two fatty acids linked to coenzyme A (CoA) carriers are first joined to glycerol-3-phosphate, yielding phosphatidic acid, which is simultaneously inserted into the membrane. A phosphatase then converts phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol. The attachment of different polar head groups to diacylglycerol then results in formation of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, or phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylinositol is formed from phosphatidic acid, rather than from diacylglycerol. Initially, most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone. However, the fatty acid distribution at the C–1 and C–2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. In many cases the acyl group which was initially transferred to glycerol, by the action of the acyl transferases, is not the same acyl group present in the phospholipid when it resides within a membrane. The remodeling of acyl groups in phospholipids is the result of the action of phospholipase A1 (PLA1) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2). The most commonly added alcohols (serine, ethanolamine and choline) also contain nitrogen that may be positively charged, whereas, glycerol and inositol do not.

SMP0000450	Phytanic Acid Peroxisomal Oxidation	 Phytanic acid, a branched chain fatty acid, is an important component of fatty acid intake, occuring in meat, fish and dairy products.  Due to its methylation, it cannot be a substrate for acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and cannot enter the mitochondrial beta oxidation pathway.  Phytanic acid is instead activated to its CoA ester form by a CoA synthetase to phytanoyl-CoA, where it can begin the first cycle of alpha oxidation.  Phytanoyl-CoA is a substrate for a specific alpha-hydroxylase (Phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase), which adds a hydroxyl group to the α-carbon of phytanic acid, creating the 19-carbon homologue, pristanic acid.  Pristanic acid then undergoes further metabolism through beta oxidation.

SMP0000479	Plasmalogen Synthesis	Plasmalogens are a class of phospholipids found in animals.  Plasmalogens are thought to influence membrane dynamics and fatty acid levels, while also having roles in intracellular signalling and as antioxidants.  Plasmalogens consist of a glycerol backbone with an vinyl-ether-linked alkyl chain at the sn-1 position, an ester-linked long-chain fatty acid at the sn-2 position, and a head group attached to the sn-3 position through a phosphodiester linkage.  It is the vinyl-ether-linkage that separates plasmalogens from other phospholipids.   Plasmalogen biosynthesis begins in the peroxisomes, where the integral membrane protein dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (DHAPAT) catalyzes the esterification of the free hydroxyl group of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) with a molecule any of long chain acyl CoA.  Next, alkyl-DHAP synthase, a peroxisomal enzyme associated with DHAPAT, replaces the fatty acid on the DHAP with a long chain fatty alcohol.  The third step of plasmalogen biosynthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase, which is found in the membrane of both the peroxisome and endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  Acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase uses NADPH as a cofactor to reduce the ketone of the 1-alkyl-DHAP using a classical hydride transfer mechanism.  The remainder of plasmalogen synthesis occurs using enzymes in the ER.  Lysophosphatidate acyltransferases (LPA-ATs) transfer the acyl component of a polyunsaturated acyl-CoA to the the 1-alkyl-DHAP, creating a 1-alkyl-2-acylglycerol 3-phosphate.  The phosphate is then removed by lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase I (PAP-I), and the head group is attached by a choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase.  The majority of plasmalogens have either ethanolamine or choline as a headgroup, although a small amount of serine and inositol-linked ether-phospholipids can also be found.  In the final step, the vinyl-ether linkage is created by plasmanylethanolamine desaturase, which catalyzes the formation of a double bond in the alkyl chain of the plasmalogen.

SMP0000024	Porphyrin Metabolism	The first reaction in porphyrin ring biosynthesis takes place in the mitochondria and involves the condensation of glycine and succinylCoA by δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS). Delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is also called 5-aminolevulinic acid. Following its synthesis ALA is transported to the cytosol, where ALA dehydratase (also called porphobilinogen synthase) dimerizes 2 molecules of ALA to produce porphobilinogen. The next step in the pathway involves the head-to-tail condensation of 4 molecules of porphobilinogen to produce hydroxymethylbilane. The enzyme for this condensation is porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG deaminase). This enzyme is also called hydroxymethylbilane synthase or uroporphyrinogen I synthase. Hydroxymethylbilane has two main fates. The most important fate is conversion to uroporphyrinogen III, the next intermediate on the path to heme. This step is mediated by uroporphyrinogen synthase and uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase. Hydroxymethylbilane can also non-enzymatically cyclized to form uroporphyrinogen I. In the cytosol, the acetate substituents of uroporphyrinogen (uroporphyrinogen III or uroporphyrinogen I) are all decarboxylated by the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. The resultant products have methyl groups in place of acetate and are known as coproporphyrinogens, with coproporphyrinogen III being the important normal intermediate in heme synthesis. Coproporphyrinogen III is transported to the interior of the mitochondrion, where 2 propionate residues are decarboxylated, yielding vinyl substituents on the 2 pyrrole rings. The colorless product is protoporphyrinogen IX. In the mitochondrion, protoporphyrinogen IX is converted to protoporphyrin IX by protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase. The final reaction in heme synthesis also takes place in the mitochondria and involves the insertion of the iron atom into the ring system generating heme b. The enzyme catalyzing this reaction is known as ferrochelatase. Heme is broken down when the heme ring is opened by the endoplasmic reticulum enzyme, heme oxygenase. This oxidation step requires heme as a substrate, and any hemin (Fe3+) is reduced to heme (Fe2+) prior to oxidation by heme oxygenase. The oxidation occurs on a specific carbon producing the linear tetrapyrrole biliverdin, ferric iron (Fe3+), and carbon monoxide (CO). This is the only reaction in the body that is known to produce CO. In the next reaction a second bridging methylene (between rings III and IV) is reduced by biliverdin reductase, producing bilirubin. Bilirubin is significantly less extensively conjugated than biliverdin causing a change in the color of the molecule from blue-green (biliverdin) to yellow-red (bilirubin). In hepatocytes, bilirubin-UDP-glucuronyltransferase (bilirubin-UGT) adds 2 equivalents of glucuronic acid to bilirubin to produce the more water soluble, bilirubin diglucuronide derivative.

SMP0000016	Propanoate Metabolism	The metabolism of propionic acid (propanoate) begins with its conversion to propionyl coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA), which is the usual first step in the metabolism of carboxylic acids. Alternatively, propionyl-CoA results from the oxidative decarboxylation of 2-ketobutyric acid. This reaction is mediated by a large, multienzyme complex such as the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. 2-hydroxybutyric acid is formed as a by-product during the formation of 2-ketobutyric acid via a reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Since propanoate has three carbons, propionyl-CoA cannot directly enter either the beta oxidation nor the citric acid cycles. In most vertebrates, propionyl-CoA is carboxylated to D-methylmalonyl-CoA, which is isomerised to L-methylmalonyl-CoA. A vitamin B12-dependent enzyme, called methylmalonyl CoA mutase catalyzes the rearrangement of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, which is an intermediate of the citric acid cycle. Malonyl-CoA, another product of propanoate metabolism, is also used in transporting alpha-ketoglutarate across the mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix. Malonyl-CoA is formed by carboxylating acetyl-CoA using the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase. One molecule of acetyl-CoA joins with a molecule of carbon dioxide, requiring energy rendered from ATP.

SMP0000005	Pterine Biosynthesis	Folates are essential cofactors that provide one-carbon moieties in various states of reduction for biosynthetic reactions. The processes shown in this pathway include transport reactions by which folates are taken up by cells and moved intracellularly, folate conjugation with glutamate (required for folate retention within a cell), as well as the synthesis of pterines, which are used in folate synthesis. Two branches are depicted: Pterin synthesis and Folate biosynthesis. In pterin synthesis, GTP is the precursor for pterin biosynthesis. The enzyme GTP-cyclohydrolase I produces dihydroneopterin triphosphate from GTP as the first step. The product is then dephosphorylated to dihydroneopterin and yields, after removal of a C2-residue from the C3-side chain 6- hydroxymethyldihydropterin, which is the precursor for folate biosynthesis. In terms of folate biosynthesis, the basic steps are: folate → dihydrofolate → tetrahydrofolate ↔ methylene-THF → methyl-THF. More specifically, the pathway leading to the formation of tetrahydrofolate (FH4) begins when folate (F) is reduced to dihydrofolate (DHF) (FH2), which is then reduced to THF. Dihydrofolate reductase catalyses the last step. Vitamin B3 in the form of NADPH is a necessary cofactor for both steps of the synthesis. Methylene-THF (CH2FH4) is formed from THF by the addition of methylene groups from one of three carbon donors: formaldehyde, serine, or glycine. Methyl tetrahydrofolate (CH3-THF) can be made from methylene-THF by reduction of the methylene group with NADPH. Another form of THF, formyl-THF (or folinic acid) results from oxidation of methylene-THF or is formed from formate donating formyl group to THF. Finally, histidine can donate a single carbon to THF to form methenyl-THF.

SMP0000050	Purine Metabolism	Purines are heterocyclic aromatic organic compounds, consisting of a pyrimidine ring fused to an imidazole ring. Purines, including substituted purines, are the most widely distributed kind of nitrogen-containing heterocycle in nature. The two most important purines are adenine and guanine. Other notable purines are hypoxanthine, xanthine, theobromine, caffeine, uric acid and isoguanine. Purines are found in a number of other important biomolecules, such as ATP, GTP, cyclic AMP, NADH, and coenzyme A. This pathway depicts a number of processes including purine nucleotide biosynthesis, purine degradation and purine salvage. The major site of purine nucleotide synthesis is in the liver. Synthesis of the purine nucleotides begins with PRPP and leads to the first fully formed nucleotide, inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP). IMP synthesis begins with 5-phospho-α-ribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, PRPP. Through a series of reactions utilizing ATP, tetrahydrofolate (THF) derivatives, glutamine, glycine and aspartate this pathway yields IMP. The rate limiting reaction is catalyzed by glutamine PRPP amidotransferase which drives the reaction with PRPP and glutamine yielding 5-phosphoribosylamine (PRA). 5-phosphoribosylamine is converted to glycinamide ribotide (GAR) then to formyglycinamide ribotide (FGAR). This set of reactions is catalyzed by a trifunctional enzyme containing GAR synthetase, GAR transformylase and AIR synthetase. FGAR is converted to formylglycinamidine-ribonucleotide (FGAM) by formylglycinamide synthase. FGAM is then converted by aminoimidzaole ribotide synthase to 5-aminoimidazole ribotide (AIR) then carboxylated by aminoimidazole ribotide carboxylase to carboxyaminoimidazole ribotide (CAIR). CAIR is then converted to succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) by succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide synthase followed by conversion to AICAR (via adenylsuccinate lyase) then to FAICAR (via aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide transformylase). FAICAR is finally converted to inosine monophosphate (IMP) by IMP cyclohydrolase. Because of the complexity of this synthetic process, the purine ring is actually composed of atoms derived from many different molecules. The N1 atom arises from the amine group of Asp, the C2 and C8 atoms originate from formate, the N3 and N9 atoms come from the amide group of Gln, the C4, C5 and N7 atoms come from Gly and the C6 atom comes from CO2. IMP represents a branch point for purine biosynthesis, because it can be converted into either AMP or GMP through two distinct reaction pathways. AMP is generated from IMP via adenylsuccinate synthetase (which adds aspartate) and adenylsuccinate lyase. GMP is generated via the action of IMP dehydrogenase and GMP synthase. Catabolism of purine nucleotides ultimately leads to the production of uric acid. Beginning from AMP, the enzymes AMP deaminase and nucleotidase work in concert to generate inosine. Alternately, AMP may be dephosphorylate by nucleotidase and then adenosine deaminase (ADA) converts the free adenosine to inosine. The enzyme purine nucleotide phosphorylase (PNP) converts inosine to hypoxanthine, while xanthine oxidase converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and finally to uric acid. GMP and XMP can also be converted to uric acid via the action of nucleotidase, PNP, guanine deaminase and xanthine oxidase. The synthesis of nucleotides from the purine bases and purine nucleosides takes place in a series of steps known as the salvage pathways. The free purine bases, adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine, can be reconverted to their corresponding nucleotides by phosphoribosylation. Two key transferase enzymes are involved in the salvage of purines: adenosine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), which catalyzes the conversion of adenine to AMP and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), which catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine to IMP.

SMP0000046	Pyrimidine Metabolism	Pyrimidines are heterocyclic aromatic organic compounds similar to benzene and pyridine. Cytosine, thymine, and uracil are pyrimidine derivatives. Synthesis of the pyrimidines is less complex than that of the purines, since the base is much simpler This pathway depicts a number of processes including pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, pyrimidine degradation and pyrimidine salvage. Pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis begins with carbamoyl phosphate. The carbamoyl phosphate used for pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis is derived from glutamine and bicarbonate and is catalyzed by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (CPS-II). Subsequently carbamoyl phosphate is incorporated into the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway through the action of aspartate transcarbamoylase, ATCase which generates carbamoyl aspartate. This is then converted to dihydroorotic acid via carbamoyl aspartate dehydrogenase, which is then converted to orotic acid via dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The enzyme orotate phosphoribosyltransferase incorporate PRPP to produce orotidine monophosphate (OMP) which is converted to UMP (uridine monopohophsate) via orotidine-5’-phosphate carboxylase. Following completion of UMP synthesis it can be phosphorylated to UTP and utilized as a substrate for CTP synthase for the synthesis of CTP. Specifically, UMP is phosphorylated twice to yield UTP. The first phosphorylation is catalyzed by uridylate kinase and the second by ubiquitous nucleoside diphosphate kinase. Finally UTP is aminated by the action of CTP synthase, generating CTP. Uridine nucleotides are also the precursors for de novo synthesis of the thymine nucleotides. The de novo pathway to thymidine nucleotdie synthesis first requires the use of deoxyUMP from the metabolism of either UDP or CDP. The deoxyUMP is converted to deoxyTMP by the action of thymidylate synthase. The methyl group is donated by N5,N10-methylene THF. In order for the thymidylate synthase reaction to continue, THF must be regenerated from DHF. This is accomplished through the action of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). THF is then converted to N5,N10-THF via the action of serine hydroxymethyl transferase. The synthesis of pyrimidines differs in two significant ways from that of purines. First, the ring structure is assembled as a free base, not built upon PRPP. Second, there is no branch in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway. The salvage pathway to dTTP synthesis involves the enzyme thymidine kinase which can use either thymidine or deoxyuridine as a substrate. Uracil can be salvaged to form UMP through the concerted action of uridine phosphorylase and uridine kinase. Formation of dTMP, by salvage of dTMP requires the action of thymine phosphorylase and thymidine kinase while the salvage of deoxycytidine is catalyzed by deoxycytidine kinase. Deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine are also substrates for deoxycytidine kinase. In terms of the catabolism of pyrimidines, they are ultimately degraded to CO2, H2O, and urea. Cytosine can be broken down to uracil which can be further broken down to N-carbamoyl-beta-alanine and then to beta-alanine. Thymine is broken down into β-aminoisobutyrate. The β-alanine and β-aminoisobutyrate serve as -NH2 donors in the transamination of α-ketoglutarate to glutamate. A subsequent reaction converts the products to malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA (which is converted to succinyl-CoA and can be shunted to the TCA cycle).

SMP0000459	Pyruvaldehyde Degradation	This Pyruvaldehyde degradation pathway (Methylglyoxal degradation;2-oxopropanal degradation), also known as the glyoxalase system, is probably the most common pathway for the degradation of pyruvaldehyde (methylglyoxal), a potentially toxic metabolite due to its interaction with nucleic acids and other proteins. Pyruvaldehyde is formed in low concentrations by glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism and protein metabolism. Pyruvaldehyde is catalyzed by the glyoxylase system, composed of the enzymes lactoylglutathione lyase (glyoxalase I) and glyoxylase II. Glyoxalase I catalyes the isomerization of the spontaneously formed hemithioacetal adduct between glutathione and pyruvaldehyde into S-lactoylglutathione. S-lactoylglutathione is then catalyzed by glyoxalase II into D-lactic acid and glutathione. D-lactic acid is then catalyzed by an unknown quinol in the membrane to pyruvic acid, which then enters pyruvate metabolism.

SMP0000060	Pyruvate Metabolism	Pyruvate sits at an intersection of key pathways of energy metabolism. It is the end product of glycolysis and the starting point for gluconeogenesis, and can be generated by transamination of alanine. It can be converted by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to acetyl CoA which can enter the TCA cycle or serve as the starting point for the synthesis of long chain fatty acids, steroids, and ketone bodies. It also plays a central role in balancing the energy needs of various tissues in the body. Under conditions in which oxygen supply is limiting, (in exercising muscle) or in the absence of mitochondria, (in red blood cells), re-oxidation of NADH produced by glycolysis cannot be coupled to generation of ATP. Instead, its re-oxidation is coupled to the reduction of pyruvate to lactate. This lactate is released into the blood, and is taken up primarily by the liver, where it is oxidized to pyruvate and can be used for gluconeogenesis. Pyruvate participates in several key reactions and pathways. In glycolysis, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is converted to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase. This reaction is strongly exergonic and irreversible. In gluconeogenesis pyruvate requires two enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase, to catalyze the reverse transformation of pyruvate to PEP. In fatty acid synthesis, pyruvate decarboxylation by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex produces acetyl-CoA. In gluconeogenesis, the carboxylation by pyruvate carboxylase produces oxaloacetate. The fate of pyruvate depends on the cell energy charge. In cells or tissues with a high energy charge pyruvate is directed toward gluconeogenesis, but when the energy charge is low pyruvate is preferentially oxidized to CO2 and H2O in the TCA cycle, with generation of 15 equivalents of ATP per pyruvate. The enzymatic activities of the TCA cycle are located in the mitochondrion. When transported into the mitochondrion, pyruvate encounters two principal metabolizing enzymes: pyruvate carboxylase (a gluconeogenic enzyme) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). With a high cell-energy charge, acetyl-CoA, is able allosterically to activate pyruvate carboxylase, directing pyruvate toward gluconeogenesis. When the energy charge is low CoA is not acylated, pyruvate carboxylase is inactive, and pyruvate is preferentially metabolized via the PDH complex and the enzymes of the TCA cycle to CO2 and H2O.

SMP0000074	Retinol Metabolism	Retinol, the animal form of vitamin A, is a fat-soluble vitamin important in vision and bone growth. Retinol is among the most usable forms of vitamin A, which also include retinal (aldehyde form), retinoic acid (acid form) and retinyl ester (ester form). Retinol is normaly ingested in a precursor form. Typically animal sources (liver and eggs) contain retinyl esters, whereas plants (carrots, spinach) contain pro-vitamin A carotenoids. Hydrolysis of retinyl esters results in retinol, while pro-vitamin A carotenoids can be cleaved to produce retinal. Retinal (retinaldehyde) can be reversibly reduced to produce retinol or it can be irreversibly oxidized to produce retinoic acid. Retinoic acid is derived from retinol by oxidation through retinol and retinal dehydrogenases and several cytochrome p450s (CYPs). Many different geometric isomers of retinol, retinal and retinoic acid are possible as a result of either a trans or cis configuration of four of the five double bonds found in the polyene chain. The cis isomers are less stable and can readily convert to the all-trans configuration. Nevertheless, some cis isomers are found naturally and carry out essential functions. For example, the 11-cis-retinal isomer is the chromophore of rhodopsin, the vertebrate photoreceptor molecule. Retinoic acid plays an important role in regulating cell growth and differentiation. Retinoic acid can be oxidized to several metabolites by a panel of CYPs that differs for the different retinoic acid isomers. CYP26A1 is involved in the metabolic breakdown of retinoic acid by 4-hydroxylation. CYP26A1-mediated 4-hydroxylation is specific for all-trans-retinoic acid but not for the isomers 13-cis-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid. CYP26C1 can also hydroxylate the trans form of retinoic acid it is unique in hydroxylating the 9-cis isomer of retinoic acid. CYP26B1 can also deactivate all-trans-retinoic acid by 4-hydroxylation. Another recently discovered cytochrome P450, called CYP2S1 is expressed in skin cells and is inducible by UV radiation, coal tar and all-trans retinoate. All trans retinoic acid also serves as a substrate for this enzyme. Phase II metabolism, mainly glucuronidation, is also observed for retinoic acid.

SMP0000070	Riboflavin Metabolism	Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is an essential component for the enzyme cofactors FAD (flavin-adenine dinucleotide) and FMN (flavin mononucleotide).  The name ""riboflavin"" actually comes from ""ribose"" and ""flavin"".  Like the other B vitamins, riboflavin is required for the metabolism of fats, ketone bodies, carbohydrates, and proteins.  Riboflavin is present in many vegetables and meat and during digestion, various flavoproteins from food are degraded and riboflavin is resorbed.  The reverse reaction is mediated by acid phosphatase 6.  FMN can be converted to FAD via FAD synthetase, while the reverse reacting is mediated by nucleotide pyrophosphatase.  FAD and FMN are important hydrogen carriers and take part in more than 100 redox reactions involved in energy metabolism.

SMP0000029	Selenoamino Acid Metabolism	Selenoamino acids include selenocysteine, selenohomocysteine and selenomethionine, amino acids containing a selenium in place of a sulfur. Selenium has important biological functions but may be toxic at high doses. It is believed its toxicity arises from its induction of oxidative stress. Many selenoproteins are antioxidants. Due to its antioxidant effects selenium has become an of interest supplement to prevent diseases and cancers. Selenium and sulfur are very similar chemically, thus sulfur metabolism enzymes will act on selenium as well to form selenoamino acids which then may replace other amino acids  in protein synthesis.

SMP0000445	Spermidine and Spermine Biosynthesis	The Spermidine and Spermine Biosynthesis pathway highlights the creation of these cruicial polyamines. Spermidine and spermine are produced in many tissues, as they are involved in the regulation of genetic processes from DNA synthesis to cell migration, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. These positiviely charged amines interact with negatively charged phosphates in nucleic acids to exert their regulatory effects on cellular processes. Spermidine originates from the action of spermidine synthase, which converts the methionine derivative S-adenosylmethionine and the ornithine derivative putrescine into spermidine 5'-methylthioadenosine. Spermidine is subsequently processed into spermine by spermine synthase in the presence of the aminopropyl donor, S-adenosylmethioninamine.

SMP0000034	Sphingolipid Metabolism	The sphingolipids, like the phospholipids, are composed of a polar head group and two nonpolar tails. The core of sphingolipids is the long-chain amino alcohol, sphingosine. Amino acylation, with a long chain fatty acid, at carbon 2 of sphingosine yields a ceramide. The sphingolipids include the sphingomyelins and glycosphingolipids (the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides). Sphingomyelins are the only sphingolipid that are phospholipids. Sphingolipids are a component of all membranes but are particularly abundant in the myelin sheath. De novo sphingolipid synthesis begins with formation of 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine by serine palmitoyltransferase. The preferred substrates for this reaction are palmitoyl-CoA and serine. Next, 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine is reduced to form dihydrosphingosine. Dihydrosphingosine is acylated by a (dihydro)-ceramide synthase to form dihydroceramide. This is desaturated to form ceramide. Ceramide may subsequently have several fates. It may be phosphorylated by ceramide kinase to form ceramide-1-phosphate. Alternatively, it may be glycosylated by glucosylceramide synthase or galactosylceramide synthase. Additionally, it can be converted to sphingomyelin by the addition of a phosphorylcholine headgroup by sphingomyelin synthase. Diacylglycerol is also generated via this process. Finally, ceramide may be broken down by a ceramidase to form sphingosine. Sphingosine may be phosphorylated to form sphingosine-1-phosphate, which may, in turn, be dephosphorylated to regerenate sphingosine. Sphingolipid catabolism allows the reversion of these metabolites to ceramide. The complex glycosphingolipids are hydrolyzed to glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide. These lipids are then hydrolyzed by beta-glucosidases and beta-galactosidases to regenerate ceramide. Similarly, sphingomyelin may be broken down by sphingomyelinase to create ceramide. The only route by which sphingolipids are converted to non-sphingolipids is through sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase. This forms ethanolamine phosphate and hexadecenal.

SMP0000058	Starch and Sucrose Metabolism	 The digestion of starch begins with the action of amylase enzymes secreted in the saliva and small intestine, which convert it to maltotriose, maltose, limit dextrins, and some glucose.  Digestion of the limit dextrins and disaccharides, both dietary and starch-derived, to monosaccharides – glucose, galactose, and fructose – is accomplished by enzymes located on the luminal surfaces of enterocytes lining the microvilli of the small intestine.  Once released from starch or once ingested, sucrose can be degraded into beta-D-fructose and alpha-D-glucose via lysosomal alpha-glucosidase or sucrose-isomaltase.  Beta-D-fructose can be converted to beta-D-fructose-6-phosphate by glucokinase and then to alpha-D-glucose-6-phosphate by the action of glucose phosphate isomerase.  Phosphoglucomutase 1 can then act on alpha-D-glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to generate alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate.  Alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate (G6P) has several possible fates.  It can enter into gluconeogenesis, glycolysis or the nucleotide sugar metabolism pathway.  UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 can convert alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate into UDP-glucose, which can then be converted to UDP-xylose or UDP-glucuronate and, eventually to glucuronate.  UDP-glucose can also serve as a precursor to the synthesis of glycogen via glycogen synthase.  More specifically, glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose by the enzyme glycogen synthase, which progressively lengthens the glycogen chain with (α1→4) bonded glucose.  As glycogen synthase can only lengthen an existing chain, the protein glycogenin is needed to initiate the synthesis of glycogen.  The glycogen-branching enzyme, amylo (α1→4) to (α1→6) transglycosylase, catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of 6-7 glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule.  The branching enzyme can only act upon a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.  Another enzyme known as starch phosphorylase or glycogen phosphorylase can also convert starch into glycogen.  Glycogen functions as the secondary short term energy storage in animal cells.  It is made primarily by the liver and the muscles, but can also be made by glycogenesis within the brain and stomach.  Glycogen is the analogue of starch, a less branched glucose polymer in plants, and is commonly referred to as animal starch, having a similar structure to amylopectin.  Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol in many cell types, and plays an important role in the glucose cycle.  Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate that is then converted to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P).  G6P can continue on the glycolysis pathway and be used as fuel or G6P can enter the pentose phosphate pathway via the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to produce NADPH and 5-carbon sugars or, in the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase.  This is the final step in the gluconeogenesis pathway.

SMP0000023	Steroid Biosynthesis	Steroid biosynthesis (Cholesterol Biosynthesis) is an anabolic metabolic pathway that produces steroids from simple precursors.  These are joined together via HMG-CoA synthase to produce hydroxy-3-methylgutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), which is then reduced to mevalonic acid via the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase.  HMG-CoA reductase is the protein target of many cholesterol lowering drugs called statins.  The mevaolonic acid is then phosphorylated by mevalonate kinase and subsequently decarboxylated to form isopentylpyrophosphate (IPP).  IPP can also be isomerized to form dimethylallylpyrophosphate (DMAPP).  Isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallylpyrophosphate donate isoprene units, which can be joined together to make farnesyl and geranylgeranyl intermediates.  Specifically, three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate condense to form farnesyl pyrophosphate through the action of geranyl transferase.  Two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate then condense to form squalene by the action of squalene synthase in the endoplasmic reticulum.  Oxidosqualene cyclase then cyclizes squalene to form lanosterol.  Lanosterol is a tetracyclic triterpenoid, which is the compound from which all steroids are derived.  14-Demethylation of lanosterol by CYP51 eventually yields cholesterol.  It can be obtained from animal fats consumed in the diet or synthesized de novo (as described above).  Cholesterol is an essential constituent of lipid bilayer membranes and is the starting point for the biosyntheses of bile acids and salts, steroid hormones, and vitamin D.  Bile acids and salts, e. g. , taurocholate, are mostly synthesized in the liver.  They are released into the intestine and function as detergents to solubilize dietary fats.  Steroid hormones are mostly synthesized in the adrenal gland and gonads.  They regulate energy metabolism and stress responses (glucocorticoids such as cortisol), salt balance (mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone), and sexual development and function (androgens and estrogens such as estradiol).

SMP0000130	Steroidogenesis	Steroidogenesis is the process wherein desired forms of steroids are generated by transformation of other steroids.  Products of steroidogenesis include androgens, testosterone, estrogens and progesterone, corticoids, cortisol and aldosterone.  The first step in the synthesis of all steroid hormones is the synthesis of pregnenolone from cholesterol.  In this process, cholesterol mobilized from cytosolic lipid droplets or from lysosomes is transported to mitochondria and becomes localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane.  In the inner mitochondrial membrane, cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone in a sequence of three reactions, all catalyzed by CYP11A (side chain cleavage enzyme).  Finally, pregnenolone re-enters the cytosol.  Pregnenolone is converted to progesterone in two reactions, both catalyzed by 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase.  Progesterone is hydroxylated by CYP21A2 to form deoxycorticosterone, which in turn is converted to aldosterone in a three-reaction sequence catalyzed by CYP11B2.  Pregnenolone is converted to 17alpha-hydoxyprogesterone in two reactions, both catalyzed by 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase.  17Alpha-hydroxyprogesterone is hydroxylated by CYP21A2 to form 11-deoxycortisol, which in turn is converted to cortisol by CYP11B1.  The conversion of the active steroid hormone, cortisol, to inactive cortisone occurs in many tissues, notably the liver.  Testosterone biosynthesis begins with pregnenolone.  Subsequent steps require several enzymes including, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17α-hydroxylase/C17-20-lyase and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3.  Specifically, pregnenolone is converted to 17-hydroxypregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone by CYP17 (17α-hydroxylase).  Dehydroepiandrosterone is then converted to androstenedione by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.  Androstenedione can have two fates, it can either be converted to estrone via CYP19 (aromatase/estrogen synthase) or it can be converted to testosterone via 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.  Free testosterone is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5-alpha reductase.  Testosterone may also be converted to estradiol by the action of CYP19 (aromatase/estrogen synthase).

SMP0000041	Sulfate/Sulfite Metabolism	This pathway illustrates the conversion of sulfite to sulfate (via sulfate oxidase) and subsequent generation of adenylylsulfate (APS) via 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthase 2. APS is converted to phosphoadenylyl-sulfate (PAPS) via adenylylsulfate kinase. APS can also be regenerated from PAPS by 3'(2'), 5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase 1. PAPS is eventually converted to adenosine bisophosphate (PAP) through the action of several different enzymes including aryl sulfotransferase, chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase 13 and estrone sulfotransferase. Sulfites are defined as compounds that contain the sulfite ion SO2−. The sulfite ion is the conjugate base of sulfurous acid. Sulfites occur naturally in all wines. Sulfites are commonly introduced to arrest fermentation at a desired time, and may also be added to wine as preservatives to prevent spoilage and oxidation at several stages of winemaking. Sulfites are also used as preservatives in dried fruits, and dried potato products.

SMP0000021	Taurine and Hypotaurine Metabolism	Taurine, or 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, is an organic acid.  Taurine is a derivative of the sulfur-containing (sulfhydryl) amino acid, cysteine.  For mammalian taurine synthesis occurs in the pancreas via the cysteine sulfinic acid pathway.  In this pathway, the sulfhydryl group of cysteine is first oxidized to cysteine sulfinic acid by the enzyme cysteine dioxygenase.  Cysteine sulfinic acid, in turn, is decarboxylated by sulfinoalanine decarboxylase to form hypotaurine.  Taurine is conjugated via its amino terminal group with chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid to form the bile salts sodium taurochenodeoxycholate and sodium taurocholate.  This reaction is catalyzed by BAAT (bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acetyltransferase).  In the body, this reaction occurs in hepatocytes and is the means by which bile acids recovered from the intestine are converted to bile salts before being released again into the bile.  The low pKa (1. 5) of taurine's sulfonic acid group ensures that this moiety is negatively charged in the pH ranges normally found in the intestinal tract.

SMP0000076	Thiamine Metabolism	Thiamin(e), also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. It consists of a pyrimidine ring (2,5-dimethyl-6-aminopyrimidine) and a thiazolium ring (4-methyl-5-hydroxy ethyl thiazole) joined by a methylene bridge. Thiamine is found in a wide variety of foods at low concentrations. Yeast and pork are the most highly concentrated sources of thiamine. Cereal grains, however, are generally the most important dietary sources of thiamine, by virtue of their ubiquity. Of these, whole grains contain more thiamine than refined grains. Thiamine is released by the action of phosphatase and pyrophosphatase in the upper small intestine. At low concentrations the process is carrier mediated and at higher concentrations, absorption occurs via passive diffusion. Active transport is greatest in the jejunum and ileum (it is inhibited by alcohol consumption and by folic deficiency). The majority of thiamine in serum is bound to proteins, mainly albumin. Uptake of thiamine by cells of the blood and other tissues occurs via active transport and passive diffusion. About 80% of intracellular thiamine is phosphorylated and most is bound to proteins. Thiamine and its acid metabolites (2-methyl-4-amino-5-pyrimidine carboxylic acid, 4-methyl-thiazole-5-acetic acid and thiamine acetic acid) are excreted principally in the urine. Thiamine is mainly the transport form of the vitamin, while the active forms are phosphorylated thiamine derivatives. There are four known natural thiamine phosphate derivatives: thiamine monophosphate (ThMP), thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), also sometimes called thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), thiamine triphosphate (ThTP), and the recently discovered adenosine thiamine triphosphate (AThTP) and adenosine thiamine diphosphate (AThDP). Thiamine monophosphate (TMP) is an intermediate to facilitate the synthesis of free thiamine to thiamine diphosphate and triphosphate. The synthesis of thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), also known as thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) or cocarboxylase, is catalyzed by an enzyme called thiamine diphosphokinase. TPP activates decarboxylation of pyruvate in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This complex is a group of enzymes and cofactors that form acetyl CoA that condenses with oxaloacetate to form citrate, the first component of the citric acid cycle.

SMP0000452	Threonine and 2-Oxobutanoate Degradation	  2-oxobutanoate, also known as 2-Ketobutyric acid, is a 2-keto acid that is commonly produced in the metabolism of amino acids such as methionine and threonine.  Like other 2-keto acids, degradation of 2-oxobutanoate occurs in the mitochondrial matrix and begins with oxidative decarboxylation to its acyl coenzyme A derivative, propionyl-CoA.  This reaction is mediated by a class of large, multienzyme complexes called 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes.  While no 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex is specific to 2-oxobutanoate, numerous complexes can catalyze its reaction.  In this pathway the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex is depicted.  All 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes consist of three main components: a 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (E1) with a thiamine pyrophosphate cofactor, a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2) with a lipoate cofactor, and a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) with a flavin cofactor.  E1 binds the 2-oxobutanoate to the lipoate on E2, which then transfers the propionyl group to coenzyme A, producing propionyl-CoA and reducing the lipoate.  E3 then transfers protons to NAD in order to restore the lipoate.  Propionyl-CoA carboxylase transforms the propionyl-CoA to S-methylmalonyl-CoA, which is then converted to R-methylmalonyl-CoA via methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase.  In the final step, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase acts on the R-methylmalonyl-CoA to produce succinyl-CoA.

SMP0000716	Thyroid Hormone Synthesis	The thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), are tyrosine-based hormones produced by the thyroid gland that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism. Iodine is necessary for the production of T3 and T4. A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T3 and T4, enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as goitre. The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. The ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is roughly 20 to 1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by deiodinases (5'-iodinase). These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine (T1a) and thyronamine (T0a). All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes, thus dietary selenium is essential for T3 production.

SMP0000466	Transfer of Acetyl Groups into Mitochondria	Acetyl-CoA is an important molecule, which is precursor to HMG CoA, which is a vital component in cholesterol and ketone synthesis. Acetyl CoA participates in the biosynthesis of fatty acids and sterols, in the oxidation of fatty acids and in the metabolism of many amino acids. It also acts as a biological acetylating agent. Acetyl-CoA is made in the mitochondria by metabolizing fatty acids, and the oxidation of pyruvate of acetyl-CoA. When the body has an excess of ATP, the energy in acetyl-Coa can be stored in the form of fatty acids. Acetyl-CoA must cross the mitochondrial membrane to the cytosol, where fatty acid synthesis takes place. Acetyl-CoA is combined with oxalacetic acid by the enzyme citrate synthase, creating citric acid. Citric acid is then transported out of the mitochondria, to the cytosol, where the enzyme citrate lyase converts citric acid back into acetyl-CoA and oxalacetic acid. Malate dehydrogenase reduces oxalacetic acid to malate, which then is either transported back into the mitochondria by the malate-alpha ketoglutarate transporter or oxidized to pyruvate by malic enzyme. Pyruvate can then be transported back into the mitochondria and undergo decarboxylation into oxalacetic acid. Malate can also be used to create NADH by the conversion of malate to oxalacetic acid by malate dehydrogenase.

SMP0000467	Trehalose Degradation	Trehalose, also known as mycose, is a 1-alpha (disaccharide) sugar found extensively but not abundantly in nature. It is thought to be implicated in anhydrobiosis – the ability of plants and animals to withstand prolonged periods of desiccation. The sugar is thought to form a gel phase as cells dehydrate, which prevents disruption of internal cell organelles by effectively splinting them in position. Rehydration then allows normal cellular activity to be resumed without the major, generally lethal damage that would normally follow a dehydration/reyhdration cycle. Trehalose is a non-reducing sugar formed from two glucose units joined by a 1-1 alpha bond giving it the name of alpha-D-glucopyranoglucopyranosyl-1,1-alpha-D-glucopyranoside. The bonding makes trehalose very resistant to acid hydrolysis, and therefore stable in solution at high temperatures even under acidic conditions. The bonding also keeps non-reducing sugars in closed-ring form, such that the aldehyde or ketone end-groups do not bind to the lysine or arginine residues of proteins (a process called glycation). The enzyme trehalase, present but not abundant in most people, breaks it into two glucose molecules, which can then be readily absorbed in the gut. Trehalose degradation begins with trehalose being broken into beta-D-glucose in the intestine by the trehalose-specific disaccaridase trehalase. Glucose is subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream, where it makes its way to the liver. Glucose is then phosphorylated by glucokinase, where it can undergo glycolysis.

SMP0000063	Tryptophan Metabolism	Tryptophan is an essential amino acid. This means that it cannot be synthesized by the organism and therefore must be part of its diet. Amino acids, including tryptophan, act as building blocks in protein biosynthesis through the action of tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase. In addition, tryptophan functions as a biochemical precursor for serotonin (a neurotransmitter), which is synthesized via tryptophan hydroxylase. Serotonin, in turn, can be converted to melatonin (a neurohormone), via N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activities. Niacin via synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine and quinolinic acids as key biosynthetic intermediates. Kynurenine is the first key branch point intermediate in tryptophan’s catabolic pathway leading to 3 fates: First, kynurenine can undergo deamination in a standard transamination reaction yielding kynurenic acid. Secondly, kynurenine can undergo a series of catabolic reactions producing 3-hydroxyanthranilate plus alanine. In this reaction, kynureninase catabolizes the conversion of kynurenine into anthranilic acid while kynurenine—oxoglutarate transaminase (also known as Kynurenine amino-transferase and glutamine transaminase K, GTK) catabolizes its conversion into kynurenic acid and kynurenine 3-hydroxylase - to 3-hydroxykynurenine. The oxidation of 3-hydroxyanthranilate converts it into 2-amino-3-carboxymuconic 6-semialdehyde, which has two fates, it can either degrade to acetoacetate or it can cyclize to quinolate. Most of the body’s 3-hydroxyanthranilate leads to acetoacetate which is why tryptophan is also a ketogenic amino acid. An important side reaction in liver involves a non-enzymatic cyclization to quinolate then via a transamination and several rearrangements yields limited amounts of nicotinic acid, which leads to production of a small amount of NAD+ and NADP+.

SMP0000006	Tyrosine Metabolism	Tyrosine is produced in cells by hydroxylating (via phenylalanine hydroxylase) the essential amino acid phenylalanine. Half of the phenylalanine required goes into the production of tyrosine; if the diet is rich in tyrosine itself, the requirements for phenylalanine are reduced by about 50%. Phenylalanine hydroxylase is a mixed-function oxygenase: one atom of oxygen is incorporated into water and the other into the hydroxyl of tyrosine. The reductant is the tetrahydrofolate-related cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, which is maintained in the reduced state by the NADH-dependent enzyme dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR). The catabolism of tyrosine starts with an α-ketoglutarate dependent transamination through the tyrosine transaminase, which generates p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The next oxidation step is catalyzed by p-hydroxylphenylpyruvate-dioxygenase and generates homogentisate (2,5-dihydroxyphenyl-1-acetate). In order to split the aromatic ring of homogentisate, a further dioxygenase, homogentistate-oxygenase is required. Through this reaction, maleylacetoacetate is created. Fumarylacetate is then generated by maleylacetoacetate-cis-trans-isomerase through rotation of the carboxyl group created from the hydroxyl group via oxidation. This cis-trans-isomerase contains glutathione as a coenzyme. Fumarylacetoacetate is finally split into acetoactate and fumarate via fumarylacetoacetate-hydrolase through the addition of a water molecule. Thereby fumarate (also a metabolite of the citric acid cycle) and acetoacetate (3-ketobutyroate) are liberated. Acetoacetate is a ketone body, which is activated with succinyl-CoA, and thereafter it can be converted into acetyl-CoA which in turn can be oxidized by the citric acid cycle or be used for fatty acid synthesis.

SMP0000065	Ubiquinone Biosynthesis	Ubiquinone is also known as coenzyme Q10. It is a 1,4-benzoquinone, where Q refers to the quinone chemical group, and 10 refers to the isoprenyl chemical subunits. Ubiquinone is a carrier of hydrogen atoms (protons plus electrons) and functions as an ubiquitous coenzyme in redox reactions, where it is first reduced to the enzyme-bound intermediate radical semiquinone and in a second reduction to ubiquinol (Dihydroquinone; CoQH2). Ubiquinone is not tightly bound or covalently linked to any known protein complex but is very mobile. In eukaryotes ubiquinones were found in the inner mito-chondrial membrane and in other membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi vesicles, lysosomes and peroxisomes. The benzoquinone portion of Coenzyme Q10 is synthesized from tyrosine, whereas the isoprene sidechain is synthesized from acetyl-CoA through the mevalonate pathway. The mevalonate pathway is also used for the first steps of cholesterol biosynthesis. The enzyme para-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase catalyzes the condensation of p-hydroxybenzoate with polyprenyl diphosphate to generate ubiquinone.

SMP0000059	Urea Cycle	About 80% of the body’s excreted nitrogen is in the form of urea which is also largely made in the liver, in a series of reactions that are distributed between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol. The series of reactions that form urea is known as the Urea Cycle (Ornithine Cylce) or the Krebs-Henseleit Cycle. The essential features of the urea cycle reactions and their metabolic regulation are as follows: Arginine from the diet or from protein breakdown is cleaved by the cytosolic enzyme arginase, generating urea and ornithine. In subsequent reactions of the urea cycle a new urea residue is built on the ornithine, regenerating arginine and perpetuating the cycle. Ornithine arising in the cytosol is transported to the mitochondrial matrix, where ornithine transcabamoylase catalyzes the condensation of ornithine with carbamoyl phosphate, producing citrulline. The energy for the reaction is provided by the high-energy anhydride of carbamoyl phosphate. The product, citrulline, is then transported to the cytosol, where the remaining reactions of the cycle take place. The synthesis of citrulline requires a prior activation of carbon and nitrogen as carbamoyl phosphate (CP). The activation step requires 2 equivalents of ATP and the mitochondrial matrix enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-I (CPS-I). In a 2-step reaction, catalyzed by cytosolic argininosuccinate synthetase, citrulline and aspartate are condensed to form argininosuccinate. The reaction involves the addition of AMP (from ATP) to the amido carbonyl of citrulline, forming an activated intermediate on the enzyme surface (AMP-citrulline), and the subsequent addition of aspartate to form argininosuccinate. Arginine and fumarate are produced from argininosuccinate by the cytosolic enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. In the final step of the cycle arginase cleaves urea from aspartate, regenerating cytosolic ornithine, which can be transported to the mitochondrial matrix for another round of urea synthesis. The fumarate, generated via the action of arginiosuccinate lyase, is reconverted to aspartate for use in the argininosuccinate synthetase reaction.

The catabolism of all three amino acids starts in muscle and yields NADH and FADH2 which can be utilized for ATP generation.  The catabolism of all three of these amino acids uses the same enzymes in the first two steps.  The first step in each case is a transamination using a single BCAA aminotransferase, with α-ketoglutarate as the amine acceptor.  As a result, three different α-keto acids are produced and are oxidized using a common branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD), yielding the three different CoA derivatives.  Isovaleryl-CoA is produced from leucine by these two reactions, alpha-methylbutyryl-CoA from isoleucine, and isobutyryl-CoA from valine.  These acyl-CoA’s undergo dehydrogenation, catalyzed by three different but related enzymes, and the breakdown pathways then diverge.  Leucine is ultimately converted into acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate; isoleucine into acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA; and valine into propionyl-CoA (and subsequently succinyl-CoA).  Under fasting conditions, substantial amounts of all three amino acids are generated by protein breakdown.  In muscle, the final products of leucine, isoleucine, and valine catabolism can be fully oxidized via the citric acid cycle; in the liver, they can be directed toward the synthesis of ketone bodies (acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA) and glucose (succinyl-CoA).  Because isoleucine catabolism terminates with the production of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA, it is both glucogenic and ketogenic.  Because leucine gives rise to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA, it is classified as strictly ketogenic.

SMP0000017	Vitamin B6 Metabolism	Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin and is part of the vitamin B complex group. Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is the active form of vitamin B6 and is a cofactor in many reactions of amino acid metabolism, including transamination, deamination, and decarboxylation. Seven forms of this vitamin are known: pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxine 5’-phosphate (PNP). pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), pyridoxamine (PM), pyridoxamine 5’-phosphate (PMP) and 4-pyridoxic acid (PA). PA is the catabolite which is excreted in the urine. The absorption of pyridoxal phosphate and pyridoxamine phosphate involves their dephosphorylation catalyzed by a membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase. Those products and non-phosphorylated forms of vitamin B6 in the digestive tract are absorbed by diffusion, which is driven by trapping of the vitamin as 5’-phosphates through the action of phosphorylation (by a pyridoxal kinase) in the jejunal mucosa. The trapped pyridoxine and pyridoxamine are oxidized to pyridoxal phosphate in the tissue. Several products of vitamin B6 metabolism are excreted in the urine including 4-pyridoxic acid. It has been estimated that 40-60% of ingested vitamin B6 is oxidized to 4-pyridoxic acid. Other products of vitamin B6 metabolism that are excreted in the urine when high doses of the vitamin have been given include pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxine and their phosphates.

SMP0000464	Vitamin K Metabolism	Vitamin K describes a group of lipophilic, hydrophobic vitamins that exist naturally in two forms (and synthetically in three others): vitamin K1, which is found in plants, and vitamin K2, which is synthesized by bacteria. Vitamin K is an important dietary component because it is necessary as a cofacter in the activation of vitamin K dependent proteins. Metabolism of vitamin K occurs mainly in the liver. In the first step, vitamin K is reduced to its quinone form by a quinone reductase such as NAD(P)H dehydrogenase. Reduced vitamin K is the form required to convert vitamin K dependent protein precursors to their active states. It acts as a cofactor to the integral membrane enzyme vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase (along with water and carbon dioxide as co-substrates), which carboxylates glutamyl residues to gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid residues on certain proteins, activating them. Each converted glutamyl residue produces a molecule of vitamin K epoxide, and certain proteins may have more than one residue requiring carboxylation. To complete the cycle, the vitamin K epoxide is returned to vitamin K via the vitamin K epoxide reductase enzyme, also an integral membrane protein. The vitamin K dependent proteins include a number of important coagulation factors, such as prothrombin. Thus, warfarin and other coumarin drugs act as anticoagulants by blocking vitamin K epoxide reductase.

SMP0000654	Warburg Effect	The Warburg Effect refers to the phenomenon that occurs in most cancer cells where instead of generating energy with a low rate of glycolysis followed by oxidizing pyruvate via the Krebs cycle in the mitochondria, the pyruvate from a high rate of glycolysis undergoes lactic acid fermentation in the cytosol. As the Krebs cycle is an aerobic process, in normal cells lactate production is reserved for anaerobic conditions. However, cancer cells preferentially utilize glucose for lactate production via this “aerobic glycolysis”, even when oxygen is plentiful. The Warburg Effect is thought to be the result of mutations to oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. It may be an adaptation to low-oxygen environments within tumors, the result of cancer genes shutting down the mitochondria, or a mechanism to aid cell proliferation via increased glycolysis. The Warburg Effect involves numerous pathways, including growth factor stimulation, transcriptional activation, and glycolysis promotion.
